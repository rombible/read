Isaiah and Malachi each spake concerning the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, in the ministry of John. From these prophets we may observe, that Christ, in his gospel, comes among us, bringing with him a treasure of grace, and a sceptre of government. Such is the corruption of the world, that there is great opposition to his progress. When God sent his Son into the world, he took care, and when he sends him into the heart, he takes care, to prepare his way before him. John thinks himself unworthy of the meanest office about Christ. The most eminent saints have always been the most humble. They feel their need of Christ's atoning blood and sanctifying Spirit, more than others. The great promise Christ makes in his gospel to those who have repented, and have had their sins forgiven them, is, they shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost; shall be purified by his graces, and refreshed by his comforts. We use the ordinances, word, and sacraments without profit and comfort, for the most part, because we have not of that Divine light within us; and we have it not because we ask it not; for we have his word that cannot fail, that our heavenly Father will give this light, his Holy Spirit, to those that ask it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-3.htm">Matthew 3:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-5.htm">Matthew 3:5-6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight&#8212;The second of these quotations is given by Matthew and Luke in the same connection, but they reserve the former quotation till they have occasion to return to the Baptist, after his imprisonment (Mt 11:10; Lu 7:27). (Instead of the words, "as it is written in the Prophets," there is weighty evidence in favor of the following reading: "As it is written in Isaiah the prophet." This reading is adopted by all the latest critical editors. If it be the true one, it is to be explained thus&#8212;that of the two quotations, the one from Malachi is but a later development of the great primary one in Isaiah, from which the whole prophetical matter here quoted takes its name. But the received text is quoted by Iren&aelig;us, before the end of the second century, and the evidence in its favor is greater in amount, if not in weight. The chief objection to it is, that if this was the true reading, it is difficult to see how the other one could have got in at all; whereas, if it be not the true reading, it is very easy to see how it found its way into the text, as it removes the startling difficulty of a prophecy beginning with the words of Malachi being ascribed to Isaiah.)

This is a description of John by his clothes; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>, to which may be added, that it was usual for penitents, and men of austere lives, and of the first class for holiness and religion, to live in deserts, to fare hard, and wear coarse apparel. Mention is made of one man, who is called,  (f), because he had on a garment of goat's hair, which cut his flesh, that so it might atone for him, for he was a penitent: <p>and with a girdle or skin about his loins; a leathern one, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>, not a golden one, such as the high priest wore, though the (g) Jews call John an high priest: he was indeed of the priestly race: his father was a priest, but he did not wear a priestly girdle, nor any of the priest's garments; <p>and he ate locusts and wild honey. The Ethiopic version renders it, "honey of earth bees": in Ethiopia was a sort of bees, little bigger than flies, and without a sting, which had their hives in the earth, where they produced honey of a white colour, very pleasant and wholesome; and this is thought, by the Ethiopians, to be the honey which John ate (h); but then there must have been the same in Judea, which does not appear. Moreover, in the land of Judea, there was , "the honey of palm trees"; and it is said (i), that it is the best honey; and therefore the Scripture calls, honey of the palm trees, honey; and the palm trees which grow in the plains and valleys, abound most with it; wherefore there was much of this about Jericho, the city of palm trees: there was also  , "honey of figs"; which in some places was in great plenty: <p>"R. Jacob ben Dosthai says (k), it is three miles from Lud to Ono (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-33.htm">Ezra 2:33</a>) one time I walked before break of day, and I went up to my ankles in honey of figs.'' <p>Dr. Lightfoot thinks, this was the honey the evangelist speaks of, and John ate of. I have observed on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a> that with the Jews, the honey of bees was lawful to eat (l) though the bees themselves were not. So Jonathan ben Uzziel paraphrases, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-20.htm">Leviticus 11:20</a>, <p>"Let the species of bees be an abomination to you, but the honey of bees may be eaten;'' <p>they being reckoned among reptiles that fly: and it may be further observed, that according to them, the honey of wasps and hornets was lawful to be eaten, as well as the honey of bees (m) and this may be truly called, as here, wild honey; for which they give these reasons (n), because it is not of the substance of their bodies, but they gather it from herbs; and because in the same manner as bees, they take it into their bodies, but do not produce it from them; though some of the doctors dissent, and think it not lawful (o). <p>(f) T.

He recalled the asceticism of the Essene. His raiment was of the coarsest texture, such as was worn by Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-8.htm" title="And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins.

His girdle, an ornament often of the greatest richness in Oriental costume and of the finest linen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to me, Go and get you a linen girdle, and put it on your loins, and put it not in water.">Jeremiah 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-10.htm" title="I clothed you also with broidered work, and shod you with badgers' skin, and I girded you about with fine linen, and I covered you with silk.">Ezekiel 16:10</a>) or cotton or embroidered with silver and gold (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm" title="Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:">Daniel 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm" title="And in the middle of the seven candlesticks one like to the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the breasts with a golden girdle.">Revelation 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-6.htm" title="And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.">Revelation 15:6</a>), was of untanned leather (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-8.htm" title="And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins.

Locusts were permitted as an article of food (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/11-21.htm" title="Yet these may you eat of every flying creeping thing that goes on all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap with on the earth;...">Leviticus 11:21-22</a>).

This was a rough, coarse garment, characteristic of the doctrine which John taught, namely, penitence and contempt of the world. Camels abounded in Syria. <span class="cmt_word">And a leathern girdle about his loins</span>. Not only the prophets, but the Jews and the inhabitants of Syria generally, used a girdle to keep the long flowing garment more closely about them, so as to leave them more free for journeying or for labour. Thus our Lord says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35</a>), "Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning." <span class="cmt_word">And he did eat locusts and wild</span> <span class="cmt_word">honey.</span> The insect called the locust (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>) was permitted to be eaten (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-22.htm">Leviticus 11:22</a>). It was used as food by the common people in Judaea. The Arabs eat them to this day; but they are considered as a common and inferior kind of food. They are a sign of temperance, poverty, and penitence. The wild honey (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) was simply honey made by wild bees, either in the trees or in the hollows of the rocks. Isidorus says that it was of an inferior flavour. Both these kinds of food were consistent with the austere life and the solemn preaching of the Baptist. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>With camels' hair (&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>Lit., hairs.
