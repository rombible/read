And he cried out </span>— Luke, <span class="ital">with a loud voice. </span>As soon as the devil saw Jesus, dreading his power, and expecting to be dispossessed, he cried out in great terror: <span class="ital">saying, </span>in the name of all the rest, <span class="ital">Let us alone, &c. Art thou come to</span> <span class="ital">destroy us </span>— By driving us out of our abodes on earth to the regions of darkness? <span class="ital">I know thee </span>— Under all the disadvantages of thy present appearance, I can sufficiently discern <span class="ital">who thou art, the Holy One of God</span> — Whom he hath sanctified and sent into the world for the destruction of my kingdom, and therefore I dread thee. It seems plain, from what is said afterward, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-27.htm" title="And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commands he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.">Mark 1:27</a>, that the other persons then present did not know Jesus to be the Son of God; how then should the demoniac know this if he had been only mad, as some vainly suppose, and not really possessed by an evil spirit? This case was so remarkable, that, as the evangelist adds, immediately our Lord’s <span class="ital">fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee. </span>However, though madmen might not know Christ, the devils could not be ignorant of him, from the time of his baptism, when the voice from heaven said, <span class="ital">This is my beloved Son, </span>&c, and therefore Satan soon after, in one of his temptations, says, <span class="ital">If thou be the Son of God,</span> &c., <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-6.htm" title="And said to him, If you be the Son of God, cast yourself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning you: and in their hands they shall bear you up, lest at any time you dash your foot against a stone.">Matthew 4:6</a>. <span class="ital">And Jesus rebuked him — </span>Not being willing to receive any testimony from Satan. <span class="ital">When the unclean spirit had torn him — </span>Or <span class="ital">convulsed him, </span>as <span class="greekheb">σπαραξαν </span>seems here to mean. Accordingly, <span class="greekheb">σπαραγμον</span>, as Grotius has observed, is sometimes used to signify <span class="ital">a convulsion. </span>It is certainly much more natural, as Doddridge observes, to understand the expression thus, than to suppose the devil to have torn him, according to the common meaning of the word <span class="ital">torn, </span>which leaves the reader to imagine that he grievously wounded him, when Luke expressly says, <span class="ital">he hurt him not. And cried with a loud voice </span>— Or, <span class="ital">noise, </span>rather, for he was forbidden to speak. Christ would neither suffer those evil spirits to speak in opposition, nor yet in favour of him. He needed not their testimony, nor would encourage it, lest any should infer that he acted in concert with them. Luke says, <span class="ital">When the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him </span>— It is remarkable, that in all the cures of this sort which our Lord performed, the person to be cured was seized with the disorder in its violence at the time of the cure, and raised from the stupor of the fit to perfect health in an instant. The reason was, that thus the reality and greatness both of the disorder and the cure were fully proved, to the conviction of every beholder. <span class="ital">And they were all amazed </span>— At so miraculous a cure; <span class="ital">insomuch that they questioned among themselves </span>— Inquired of each other, and reasoned together, <span class="ital">saying, What new doctrine is this? </span>— Luke, <span class="greekheb">τις ο λογος ουτος</span>, <span class="ital">what a word is this! </span>How powerful is this man’s word, or command! <span class="ital">for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits </span>— An indubitable proof that his doctrine was attended with an extraordinary power: <span class="ital">and immediately his fame </span>— Raised by this signal miracle, <span class="ital">spread abroad throughout all the region </span>— And made way for his reception in the progress which he afterward took into every place of the neighbouring country.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:23-28 The devil is an unclean spirit, because he has lost all the purity of his nature, because he acts in direct opposition to the Holy Spirit of God, and by his suggestions defiles the spirits of men. There are many in our assemblies who quietly attend under merely formal teachers; but if the Lord come with faithful ministers and holy doctrine, and by his convincing Spirit, they are ready to say, like this man, What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth! No disorder could enable a man to know Jesus to be the Holy One of God. He desires to have nothing to do with Jesus, for he despairs of being saved by him, and dreads being destroyed by him. See whose language those speak, that say to the Almighty, Depart from us. This unclean spirit hated and dreaded Christ, because he knew him to be a Holy One; for the carnal mind is enmity against God, especially against his holiness. When Christ by his grace delivers souls out of the hands of Satan, it is not without tumult in the soul; for that spiteful enemy will disquiet those whom he cannot destroy. This put all who saw it upon considering, What is this new doctrine? A work as great often is wrought now, yet men treat it with contempt and neglect. If this were not so, the conversion of a notorious wicked man to a sober, righteous, and godly life, by the preaching of a crucified Saviour, would cause many to ask, What doctrine is this?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A man with an unclean spirit - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>.
