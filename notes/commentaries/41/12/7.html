It is sad to think what base usage God's faithful ministers have met with in all ages, from those who have enjoyed the privileges of the church, but have not brought forth fruit answerable. God at length sent his Son, his Well-beloved; and it might be expected that he whom their Master loved, they also should respect and love; but instead of honouring him because he was the Son and Heir, they therefore hated him. But the exaltation of Christ was the Lord's doing; and it is his doing to exalt him in our hearts, and to set up his throne there; and if this be done, it cannot but be marvellous in our eyes. The Scriptures, and faithful preachers, and the coming of Christ in the flesh, call on us to render due praise to God in our lives. Let sinners beware of a proud, carnal spirit; if they revile or despise the preachers of Christ, they would have done so their Master, had they lived when he was upon earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this parable explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-46</a>.<p>See this parable explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-46</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 12<p>Mr 12:1-12.
