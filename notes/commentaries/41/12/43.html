He sought to teach them to judge of acts by other than a quantitative standard. For him the widow’s mites and the ointment that might have been sold for 300 pence stood on the same level, so far as each was the expression of a generous and self-sacrificing love.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:41-44 Let us not forget that Jesus still sees the treasury. He knows how much, and from what motives, men give to his cause. He looks at the heart, and what our views are, in giving alms; and whether we do it as unto the Lord, or only to be seen of men. It is so rare to find any who would not blame this widow, that we cannot expect to find many who will do like to her; and yet our Saviour commends her, therefore we are sure that she did well and wisely. The feeble efforts of the poor to honour their Saviour, will be commended in that day, when the splendid actions of unbelievers will be exposed to contempt.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This poor widow hath cast more in ... - That is, more in proportion to her means, and therefore more that was acceptable to God. He does not mean that this was more in value than all which the others had put in but it showed more love to the sacred cause, more self-denial, and, of course, more sincerity in what she did.

She gave more, when she threw in those two mites, than all the others were giving - more, that is, in the estimation of him who sees not as man sees. God does not weigh the gift so much as the mind of the giver. That gift is really the greater in his sight, not which is actually of greater value, but which is greater in respect of the giver. Therefore this poor widow, when she gave her farthing, gave more than they all, because she gave all her living - all, that is, that she had beforehand for that day, trusting that the Lord would give her her bread for that day. And so she carried  off the palm for liberality, Christ himself proudly present, but what you offer with being the Judge. St. Ambrose says, "That humility and devotion." which God esteems is not that which you proudly present, but what you offer with humility and devotion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>This poor widow (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;)<p>The Greek order is very suggestive, forming a kind of climax: this window, the poor one, or and she poor. </body></html>
