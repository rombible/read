They seek the highest places at such banquets, our Lord seems to say, and when there, this is what they feast on. The special charge is not reported by St. Matthew in this connection, but occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-14.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayer: therefore you shall receive the greater damnation.">Matthew 23:14</a>, where see Note. The better MSS., indeed, omit it even there. The relative pronoun gives a wrong idea of the construction. We have really a new sentence. “They that devour . . . these shall receive . . .”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:35-40 When we attend to what the Scriptures declare, as to the person and offices of Christ, we shall be led to confess him as our Lord and God; to obey him as our exalted Redeemer. If the common people hear these things gladly, while the learned and distinguished oppose, the former are happy, and the latter to be pitied. And as sin, disguised with a show of piety, is double iniquity, so its doom will be doubly heavy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which devour widows' houses - Which devour the families of widows, or the means of supporting their families. This they did under pretence of counseling them in the knowledge of the law and in the management of their estates. They took advantage of their ignorance and their unprotected state, and either extorted large sums for their counsel, or perverted the property to their own use.<p>No wonder that our Saviour denounced them! If there is any sin of special enormity, it is that of taking advantage of the circumstances of the poor, the needy, and the helpless, to wrong them out of the pittance on which they depend for the support of their families; and as God is the friend of the widow and the fatherless, it may be expected that such will be visited with heavy condemnation.<p>For a pretence - For show, or "pretending" great devotion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40. Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation&#8212;They took advantage of their helpless condition and confiding character to obtain possession of their property, while by their "long prayers" they made them believe they were raised far above "filthy lucre." So much the "greater damnation" awaited them. (Compare Mt 23:33).

Grotius, Meyer, and Schanz take <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-40.htm" title="Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.">Mark 12:40</a> as a really independent sentence. Lk. set the precedent for this; for, apparently having Mk.’s text before him, he turns <span class="greekheb">f1οἱ κατεσθίοντες</span> into <span class="greekheb">οἱ κατεσθίουσι</span>. Holtzmann, H. C., is undecided between the two views. As to the sense, two facts are stated about the scribes: they devoured the houses, the property of widows, and they made long (<span class="greekheb">μακρὰ</span>, <span class="ital">vide</span> on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-47.htm" title="Which devour widows' houses, and for a show make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.">Luke 20:47</a>) prayers in the homes of, and presumably for, these widows.—<span class="greekheb">προφάσει</span>: the real aim to get money, the long seemingly fervent prayers a blind to hide this aim. It is not necessary to suppose that the money-getting and the praying were connected by regular contract (so apparently Fritzsche, and Weiss in Meyer). For <span class="greekheb">πρόφασις</span> <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-18.htm" title="What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.">Php 1:18</a> and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="For neither at any time used we flattering words, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is witness:">1 Thessalonians 2:5</a>.—<span class="greekheb">οὗτοι λήψονται</span>, etc.: this remark applies specially to the conduct just described: catching widows’ substance with the bait of prayer, which Jesus characteristically pronounces exceptionally damnable in view of its sleek hypocrisy and low greed. The appending of this reflection favours the view that <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-40.htm" title="Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.">Mark 12:40</a> is after all an independent sentence. In it and the two preceding we have a very slight yet vivid picture of Pharisaic piety in its vanity, avarice, and hypocrisy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/mark/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">40</span>. <span class="ital">devour widows’ houses</span>] as guardians and administrators of their property<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">greater damnation</span>] “pei taken longe dom,” Wyclif. The word denotes “judgment,” “punishment.” The verb from which it comes denotes “to judge,” pass sentence, condemn. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-29.htm" title="For he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.">1 Corinthians 11:29</a>, the words rendered <span class="ital">damnation, discerning, judged</span>, and <span class="ital">condemnation</span>, are all, in the original, parts or derivations of one and the same word; and so Wyclif admirably rendered them into the language of his day by words connected with one and the same English verb; “He that etith and drinkith vnworthili, etith and drinkith <span class="ital">doom</span> to him, not wisely <span class="ital">demyng</span> the bodi of the Lord … and if we <span class="ital">demyden</span> wiseli us silf we schulden not be <span class="ital">demyd</span>, but while we be <span class="ital">demyd</span> of the lord we ben chastised, that we be not <span class="ital">dampnyd</span> with this world.” Compare also Chaucer, <span class="ital">Monk’s Tale</span>, 15091,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Dampnyd</span> was he to deye in that prison.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Bible Word-Book</span>, pp. 142, 143.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/12.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-40.htm" title="Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.">Mark 12:40</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οἱ κατεσθίοντες</span>, <span class="ital">who devour</span>) Construe with the following words.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - There is a change in the construction here, which is not marked in the Authorized Version.

The sentence thus read is far more graphic. The statement thus becomes indeed more general, but the reference is still to the scribes who through their avarice swallowed up the property of helpless widows, and through their hypocrisy, in the hope of thus more effectually imposing upon their victims, lengthened out their prayers. <span class="accented">Greater condemnation.</span> The word in the Greek is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, that is, "judgment." A severer sentence would fall upon them in the day of judgment and a heavier condemnation, because, under the semblance of piety, they practiced iniquity, and indulged their avarice under the mask of religion. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Widows' houses<p>People often left their whole fortune to the temple, and a good deal of the temple-money went, in the end, to the Scribes and Pharisees.
