These chests, being thirteen in number, had each of them an inscription, signifying for what use the offerings put into them were destined; and were fixed to the pillars of the portico which surrounded the court. From these voluntary contributions were bought wood for the altar, salt, and other necessaries, not provided for any other way. It was in this court of the women, according to the Talmudists, that the libation of water from Siloam was made annually at the feast of tabernacles, as a solemn public thanksgiving and prayer for the former and latter rain; to which rite, it is generally supposed, our Lord alluded, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-38.htm" title="He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.">John 7:38</a>.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">And beheld how the people cast money into the treasury </span>— Luke says, <span class="ital">he looked up, and saw the rich men casting in their gifts, </span>&c. — That is, he noticed it with attentive observation; many of these, as Mark here informs us, <span class="ital">casting in much, </span>for, it seems, there was still this remainder of national liberality among them, though true religion was sunk to so very low an ebb. <span class="ital">And there came a certain poor widow — </span>Whose character and circumstances were not unknown to Christ; <span class="ital">and she threw in two mites </span>— Two small pieces of brass coin then in use; <span class="ital">which make a farthing </span>— <span class="greekheb">Καδραντης</span>, a Roman coin, in value no more than three-fourths of our farthing. Wherefore the offering given by this poor widow was very small in itself, though in another respect it was a great gift, being <span class="ital">all that she had, ever all her living. </span>We can hardly suppose, that at each of the chests there were officers placed to receive and count the money which the people offered, and to name the sum aloud before they put it in. It is more reasonable to fancy that each person put his offering privately into the chest, by a slit in its top. Wherefore, by mentioning the particular sum which this poor widow put in, as well as by declaring that it was <span class="ital">all her living, </span>our Lord showed that nothing was hid from his knowledge. <span class="ital">And he called unto him his disciples </span>— That he might inform them of this woman’s generous action, and that they might hear his remarks upon it: <span class="ital">and saith, Verily, this poor widow hath cast more in than all they, </span>&c. — Thus he spoke to show, that it is the disposition of the mind, in deeds of charity, and in oblations made to the worship of God, which God regards, and not the magnificence of the gift. <span class="ital">For all they did cast in of their abundance </span>— Their offerings, though great in respect of hers, bore but a small proportion to their estates. <span class="ital">But she of her want did cast in all that she had </span>— Her offering was the whole of her income for that day, or, perhaps, the whole of the money in her possession at that time. Here then we see what judgment is passed on the most specious outward actions by the Judge of all! And how acceptable to him is the smallest, which springs from self- denying love! Both the poor and the rich may learn an important lesson from this passage of the gospel. The poor, who seem to have the means of doing charitable offices denied them in a great measure, are encouraged by it to do what they can; because, although it may be little, God, who looks into the heart, values it not according to what it is in itself, but according to the disposition with which it is given. On the other hand, it shows the rich, that it is not enough that they exceed the poor in the quantity of their charity. A little given where a little is left behind, often appears in the eye of God a much nobler offering, and discovers a far greater strength of good dispositions, than sums vastly larger bestowed out of a plentiful abundance.

He knows how much, and from what motives, men give to his cause. He looks at the heart, and what our views are, in giving alms; and whether we do it as unto the Lord, or only to be seen of men. It is so rare to find any who would not blame this widow, that we cannot expect to find many who will do like to her; and yet our Saviour commends her, therefore we are sure that she did well and wisely. The feeble efforts of the poor to honour their Saviour, will be commended in that day, when the splendid actions of unbelievers will be exposed to contempt.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sat over against - Opposite to, in full sight of.<p>The treasury - This was in the court of the women.

For the understanding of this history, both as to the letter and profitable instruction arising from it, we must know, that in the temple (where our Saviour now was) there was a treasury, or rather treasuries. And famous Dr. Lightfoot said, there were treasure chambers, called <span class="ital">Lesacoth, </span> and thirteen treasure chests, called <span class="ital">Shopheroth, </span> all called by the general name of <span class="ital">Corban</span> or <span class="ital">Corbonah.</span> Two of these chests were for the half shekel, which every Israelite was to pay according to the law, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-12.htm" title="When you take the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul to the LORD, when you number them; that there be no plague among them, when you number them.">Exodus 30:12</a>,13</span>. There were eleven more, the inscription upon which showed what money should be put there. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. For the price of the two turtle doves, or two young pigeons.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. For the burnt offering of birds.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. For the money offered to buy wood for the altar.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. For those who gave money to buy frankincense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. For those who offered gold for the mercy seat.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>6. For the residue of the money for the sin offering.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>7. For the residue of the money for a trespass offering.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>8. For the residue of an offering of birds.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>9. For the surplus of a Nazarite’s offering.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>10. For the residue of a leper’s trespass offering.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>11. For whosoever would offer an offering of the herd.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The Israelites, tied to their several offerings, were not tied to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>provide them themselves, but they might bring sums of money, with which the priests provided them, and if there were a surpulsage, it was put into one or other of these chests. These chests were placed in that part of the temple which was called the court of the women, not because none but women might come there, but because women might go no further, as the court of the Gentiles (into which Jews came) was so called because the Gentiles might go no further. Our Lord so sat, as he observed men come and put their offerings into one of these chests. He saw many Jews that were rich casting in much money of silver, or gold, or brass, though brass money was most in use. Amongst others a poor widow came; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.</span> As to the value of what she threw in, let us hear the learned Dr. Lightfoot in his Temple Service, chapter 19. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“The weight of the piece of silver mentioned in the law, was three hundred and twenty barley corns. The wise men added to it, and made it four hundred and eighty-four middle barley corns. This made four Denarii; each Denarius made six Meahs, which in Moses’s time was called a Gerah. The Meah made two Pondions; the Pondion made two Issarines or Assariusses. The Assarius, or Issarine, was the weight of four barley corns, the weight of a mite was half a barley corn.” <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to this rate, the widows’s two mites made in silver the weight of a middle barley corn. This our Saviour calls <span class="ital">all that she had, </span> and <span class="ital">all her living.</span> The Greek is <span class="ital">all her life, </span> that is, all that she had to sustain her life. Arias Montanus thinks that that which is meant is, all that she had to uphold her life for one day. For it is said, that this quantity was usually reckoned the livelihood, or a sufficiency, for a poor man for a day. Christ said, she had cast in more than any of the rest; not more strictly, but <span class="ital">Proverbs rata, </span> comparing what they were able to do with what she was able to do. The two great instructions which this history affords us are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That the poorer sort of people are not excused from good works, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-2.htm" title="How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.">2 Corinthians 8:2</a>,3</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That God in his acceptation of our good works looks at the heart, the will, and affections, not at the quantum of what we do: <span class="ital">If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-12.htm" title="For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man has, and not according to that he has not.">2 Corinthians 8:12</a></span>. It is the obedience and love which God accepteth, not the quantum of the gift. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jesus sat over against the treasury,.... the Arabic version reads, "at the door of the treasury"; the place where the chests stood, into which money was put for various uses: there were thirteen chests in the temple (d); six of them were,  for voluntary oblations, or freewill offerings; for what remained of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the turtles; for those that had fluxes, and for new mothers; and of the sacrifices of the Nazarite, and of the trespass offering for the leper; and the last was for a freewill offering in general; and into one of these chests, or all them, was the money cast, afterwards spoken of. The Ethiopic version renders it, "over against the alms chest"; but this contribution in the temple, was not for the maintenance of the poor, but for the supply of sacrifices, and other things, as mentioned. Jesus having done preaching, and the Scribes and Pharisees having left him, and the multitude being dismissed, he sat down, being weary, and rested himself in this place: <p>and beheld; with pleasure. <p>how the people, of all sorts, rich and poor, <p>cast money into the treasury; into one or other of the above chests: the word rendered "money", signifies "brass", which the Jews call,  for they had shekels of brass, as well as silver; and brazen pence, as well as silver pence (e); and also "prutas", or mites of brass (f); and such, the poor woman cast in: <p>and many that were rich cast in much: they gave very liberally and largely, as they were possessed with much worldly substance; for though religion was at a low ebb with them, yet they took care to support the external and ritual part of it. <p>(d) Misn.
