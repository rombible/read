Note also the real reverence shown in the form of address, “Master,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> “Teacher, Rabbi.” He recognises the speaker as one of his own order. This, and all that follows, is peculiar to St. Mark, and is an addition of singular interest, as showing the existence among the scribes of some who accepted our Lord’s teaching as to the spiritual meaning of the Law, and were able to distinguish between its essence and its accidents.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/mark/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/12-32.htm" title="And the scribe said to him, Well, Master, you have said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:...">Mark 12:32-34</a></span>. <span class="ital">The scribe </span>— Who had proposed the question to try him, being struck with the solidity and spirit of his answer, <span class="ital">said, Well, Master</span> — In the original it is, <span class="greekheb">καλως</span>, <span class="ital">excellently, finely, </span>or <span class="ital">beautifully; </span>a phrase which expresses his high satisfaction in the reply much more strongly than the word <span class="ital">well.

Reader, art thou not far from the kingdom of God? Then go on: be a real Christian; else it had been better for thee to have been afar off.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:28-34 Those who sincerely desire to be taught their duty, Christ will guide in judgment, and teach his way. He tells the scribe that the great commandment, which indeed includes all, is, that of loving God with all our hearts. Wherever this is the ruling principle in the soul, there is a disposition to every other duty. Loving God with all our heart, will engage us to every thing by which he will be pleased. The sacrifices only represented the atonements for men's transgressions of the moral law; they were of no power except as they expressed repentance and faith in the promised Saviour, and as they led to moral obedience. And because we have not thus loved God and man, but the very reverse, therefore we are condemned sinners; we need repentance, and we need mercy. Christ approved what the scribe said, and encouraged him. He stood fair for further advance; for this knowledge of the law leads to conviction of sin, to repentance, to discovery of our need of mercy, and understanding the way of justification by Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This answer of the scribe is not found in Matthew.<p>Is more than all - Is of more importance and value.<p>Discreetly - Wisely, according to truth.<p>Not far from the kingdom of God - Thou who dost prefer the "internal" to the "external" worship of God - who hast so just a view of the requirements of the law - canst easily become a follower of me, and art almost fit to be numbered among my disciples. This shows that a proper understanding of the Old Testament, of its laws and requirements, would prepare the mind for Christianity, and suit a person at once to embrace it when presented. One system is grafted on the other, agreeably to <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>.<p>And no man after that durst ask him any question - That is, no one of the scribes, the Pharisees, or the Sadducees durst ask him a question for the purpose of "tempting" him or entangling him. He had completely silenced them. It does not appear, however, but that his "disciples" dared to ask him questions for the purpose of information. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32.

This reply of the Scribe, is not related by Matthew: <p>well, Master, thou hast said the truth: what thou hast said is truth, and thou hast expressed it in a most beautiful manner: the Scribe was charmed with his answer, and could not forbear speaking in commendation of it, and even before the multitude, and those of his own sect: this was a rare and uncommon instance; it was not usual with the Scribes and Pharisees, whatever convictions they were laid under, either by the miracles or discourses of Christ, to own any thing, or make any concessions in his favour, or speak in his praise: but this man not only commends him, but gives reasons for it, and confirms the doctrine he taught in his own words; <p>for there is one God, and there is none other but he. The Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions, leave out the word "God"; but it is in the Greek copies, and rightly retained in other versions: for the sense is, that there is one God, and but one; and which is perfectly agreeable to the Christian doctrine, of a Trinity of persons in the Godhead; for though the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God, yet there are not three Gods, but one God. Nor are we to imagine, that this man said or thought any thing to the contrary, or had it in his mind to oppose the doctrine of the Trinity; which, though more clearly revealed in the New Testament, was not unknown to the ancient Jews, and might be learned from the writings of the Old Testament: but this he said, in opposition to the many idols, and fictitious deities of the Gentiles; and if he spake in the Hebrew language, as it is probable he did, there must be a beautiful "paranomasia" in his words; "for there is",  "Achad, one God; and there is none",  "Achar, other but he": and it is observed by a Jewish writer (y), that the reason why the last letter of,  "one", is greater than the rest, as before observed, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-29.htm">Mark 12:29</a> is, that there might be no mistake of  for  which are much alike; and if mistook, the word would signify "another", and not "one": but this is done, lest a man should mistake, and worship "another", and not the "one" God. <p>(y) Baal Hatturim, ib. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/12.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-32.htm" title="And the scribe said to him, Well, Master, you have said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:">Mark 12:32</a>. <span class="greekheb">καλῶς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐπʼ ἀληθείας</span>: to be taken together = well indeed!—<span class="greekheb">εἷς ἐστὶν</span>: He is one (God understood, supplied in T.R.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/12.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-32.htm" title="And the scribe said to him, Well, Master, you have said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:">Mark 12:32</a>. <span class="greekheb">Κακῶς</span>, <span class="ital">excellently</span> [well]) Construe with. <span class="ital">Thou hast said</span>: for His “saying well” is made to rest <span class="ital">on the truth</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐπʼ ἀληθείας</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-25.htm" title="But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;">Luke 4:25</a> [<span class="greekheb">ἐπʼ ἀληθείας λέγω</span>, <span class="ital">I say, resting on the truth</span>, “I say of a truth”], <span class="greekheb">εἷς ἐστι καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἄλλος πλὴν αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">there is One, and there is none other but He) There is One</span> [or rather <span class="ital">He is One</span>], an absolute phraseology, is repeated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-29.htm" title="And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:">Mark 12:29</a>, that is, from Moses’ writings; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-9.htm" title="And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one.">Zechariah 14:9</a>.
