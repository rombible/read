Here they form part of the parable itself. We may think of them as having been probably taken up and repeated by our Lord after they had been uttered by others.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:1-12 Christ showed in parables, that he would lay aside the Jewish church. It is sad to think what base usage God's faithful ministers have met with in all ages, from those who have enjoyed the privileges of the church, but have not brought forth fruit answerable. God at length sent his Son, his Well-beloved; and it might be expected that he whom their Master loved, they also should respect and love; but instead of honouring him because he was the Son and Heir, they therefore hated him. But the exaltation of Christ was the Lord's doing; and it is his doing to exalt him in our hearts, and to set up his throne there; and if this be done, it cannot but be marvellous in our eyes. The Scriptures, and faithful preachers, and the coming of Christ in the flesh, call on us to render due praise to God in our lives. Let sinners beware of a proud, carnal spirit; if they revile or despise the preachers of Christ, they would have done so their Master, had they lived when he was upon earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this parable explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-46</a>.<p>See this parable explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-46</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 12<p>Mr 12:1-12.

As the former clause contains a question put by Christ upon his having finished the parable, this is an answer to it, given by the chief priests, Scribes, and elders, in whose presence, and for whose sake it was delivered; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-41.htm">Matthew 21:41</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/mark/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">he will come</span>] According to St Matthew, this was the answer of the Pharisees themselves, either, before they were aware, pronouncing sentence against themselves, or pretending in the hardness of their hearts not to see the drift of the Parable. The answer was followed by “a deep God forbid” from several voices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-16.htm" title="He shall come and destroy these farmers, and shall give the vineyard to others.

St. Luke, as St. Mark here, assigns the answer to our Lord. It would seem probable that the scribes first answered him, and that then he himself repeated their answer, and confirmed it by his looks and gesture; so that from thence, as well as from what followed, they might sufficiently understand that he spake these things of them. Then, according to St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-16.htm">Luke 20:16</a>), they subjoined the words, "God forbid!" an expression wrung from their consciences, which accused them and told them that the parable applied to them. Here, then, we have a distinct prediction of the rejection of the Jews and the call of the Gentiles. </body></html>
