Nothing is more likely to insnare the followers of Christ, than bringing them to meddle with disputes about worldly politics. Jesus avoided the snare, by referring to the submission they had already made as a nation; and all that heard him, marvelled at the great wisdom of his answer.

Unto Jesus in the temple: <p>they said unto him, master; they saluted him in like manner, as they did their doctors and Rabbins, calling him "Rabbi", though they were not his disciples; but one part of them were the disciples of the Pharisees, and the other had Herod for their master; <p>we know that thou art true; an honest, sincere, and upright man, <p>and carest for no man, for thou regardest not the person of men; no, not Caesar himself; <p>but teachest the way of God in truth; instructest men in the word, will, and worship of God, with all integrity and faithfulness; answer therefore this question, <p>is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not? The Syriac and Persic versions read, "head money"; and so it is read in Beza's most ancient copy; a tax that was levied on the heads of families; or on every particular head in a family; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-17.htm">Matthew 22:17</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> regardest not the person of men, but teachest the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</span><p>(d) You do not judge by the outward appearance, so that the truth is therefore not darkened by any means at all.<p>(e) The way by which we come to see God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/12.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-14.htm" title="And when they were come, they say to him, Master, we know that you are true, and care for no man: for you regard not the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?">Mark 12:14</a>. The flattering speech is differently and more logically (Schanz) given in Mt. <span class="ital">Vide</span> notes there on the virtues specified.—<span class="greekheb">ἔξεστιν</span>, etc.: the question now put, and in two forms in Mk. First, as in Mt., is it lawful, etc.; second, in the added words, <span class="greekheb">δῶμεν ἢ μὴ δῶμεν</span>; These have been distinguished as the theoretical and the practical form of the question respectively (Meyer, Weiss, Schanz), but there is no real difference. Yet it is not idle repetition. The second question gives urgency to the matter; They speak as men who press for an answer for their guidance (Holtz., H.

The tribute-money alluded to was a capitation tax levied by the Roman government, and keenly resented by Judas the Gaulonite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-37.htm" title="After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.">Acts 5:37</a>) and his followers.
