As she was a good woman, so a good mother. This sent her to Christ. His saying, Let the children first be filled, shows that there was mercy for the Gentiles, and not far off. She spoke, not as making light of the mercy, but magnifying the abundance of miraculous cures among the Jews, in comparison with which a single cure was but as a crumb. Thus, while proud Pharisees are left by the blessed Saviour, he manifests his compassion to poor humbled sinners, who look to him for children's bread.

For with those words of Christ; she was abundantly satisfied, and went away with as great a faith, and as strong a persuasion of the dispossession, as that she came with, that Christ was able to effect it: and accordingly <p>she found the devil gone out; of her daughter; that she was entirely dispossessed of him, and no more vexed and tormented with him, but in perfect ease, and at rest: <p>and her daughter laid upon the bed; without any violent motions, convulsions, and tossings to and fro, as before; but composed and still, taking some rest, having been for some time greatly fatigued with the possession. The Ethiopic version reads, "she found her daughter clothed, and sat upon the bed": for persons in these possessions, would often put off their clothes, and tear them in pieces; and were seldom composed, and rarely sat long in a place or posture; but now it was otherwise with her. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-30.htm" title="And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid on the bed.">Mark 7:30</a>. <span class="greekheb">βεβλημένον</span>: the emphasis lies on this word rather than on <span class="greekheb">παιδίον</span> (Bengel), as expressing the condition in which the mother found her daughter: lying <span class="ital">quietly</span> (“in lecto molliter cubantem sine ullâ jactatione,” Grotius).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is probable that this interesting incident cannot be fully understood without taking into consideration circumstances not mentioned in the narratives, and which, therefore, it does not fall to the expositor to refer to.
