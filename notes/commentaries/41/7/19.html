The “heart” is, after the common Hebrew idiom, the symbol of the mind as well as the affections. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-7.htm" title="And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,">Proverbs 7:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-4.htm" title="Whoever is simple, let him turn in here: as for him that wants understanding, she said to him,">Proverbs 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-16.htm" title="Whoever is simple, let him turn in here: and as for him that wants understanding, she said to him,">Proverbs 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-13.htm" title="In the lips of him that has understanding wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.">Proverbs 10:13</a>, in all of which “understanding” stands for the Hebrew of “heart.”)<p><span class= "bld">Purging all meats.</span>—This also is peculiar to St. Mark, and presents some difficulties. In the commonly received text, the participle is in the neuter nominative, agreeing with the nominative to the verb “goeth out.” But in this construction it is difficult to see in what sense that which goeth into the mouth—itself an article of food, with no special character—can be said to purge or cleanse all other forms of food. The better MSS., however, give the participle in the masculine. This has been explained by many as a grammatical anomaly, and the participle being treated as if it agreed (though in a different case) with the word “draught” or “cesspool,” the latter is said to cleanse all meats, as removing the <span class= "ital">excreta,</span> or impure parts, from them, and leaving only that which nourishes the body. A far better construction, both as to grammar and meaning, is found by making the word “purging,” or better, <span class= "ital">cleansing,</span> agree with the subject of the verb “He saith,” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-18.htm" title="And he said to them, Are you so without understanding also? Do you not perceive, that whatever thing from without enters into the man, it cannot defile him;">Mark 7:18</a>—“He saith this . . . and in so saying, cleanseth all meats.” So taken, the words anticipate, in almost the same terms, the truth of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-15.htm" title="And the voice spoke to him again the second time, What God has cleansed, that call not you common.">Acts 10:15</a>, “What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.” The construction is tenable grammatically, has the support of high authority both ancient and modern, and obviously gives a much better sense. It is a possible conjecture that the words “cleansing all meats” may have been, at first, a marginal note (like the addition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-16.htm" title="If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.">Mark 7:16</a>), attached to “He saith,” and have afterwards found their way into the text.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:14-23 Our wicked thoughts and affections, words and actions, defile us, and these only. As a corrupt fountain sends forth corrupt streams, so does a corrupt heart send forth corrupt reasonings, corrupt appetites and passions, and all the wicked words and actions that come from them. A spiritual understanding of the law of God, and a sense of the evil of sin, will cause a man to seek for the grace of the Holy Spirit, to keep down the evil thoughts and affections that work within.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Entereth not into his heart - Does not reach or affect the "mind," the "soul," and consequently cannot pollute it. Even if it should affect the "body," yet it cannot the "soul," and consequently cannot need to be cleansed by a religious ordinance. The notions of the Pharisees, therefore, are not founded in reason, but are mere "superstition."<p>The draught - The sink, the vault. "Purging all meats." The word "purging," here, means to purify, to cleanse. What is thrown out of the body is the innutritious part of the food taken into the stomach, and leaving only that which is proper for the support of life; and it cannot, therefore, defile the soul.<p>All meals - All food; all that is taken into the body to support life. The meaning is, that the economy or process by which life is supported "purifies" or "renders nutritious" all kinds of food. The unwholesome or innutritious parts are separated, and the wholesome only are taken into the system. This agrees with all that has since been discovered of the process of digestion and of the support of life. The food taken into the stomach is by the gastric juice converted into a thick pulp called chyme. The nutritious part of this is conveyed into small vessels, and changed into a milky substance called "chyle." This is poured by the thoracic duct into the left subclavian vein and mingles with the blood, and conveys nutriment and support to all parts of the system. The useless parts of the food are thrown off.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 7<p>Mr 7:1-23.

The contrast makes the point clearer. The idea throughout is that ethical defilement is alone of importance, all other defilement, whether the subject of Mosaic ceremonial legislation or of scribe tradition, a trivial affair. Jesus here is a critic of Moses as well as of the scribes, and introduces a religious revolution.—<span class="greekheb">καθαρίζων</span> (not -<span class="greekheb">ον</span>) is accepted generally as the true reading, but how is it to be construed? as the nominative absolute referring to <span class="greekheb">ἀφεδρῶνα</span>, giving the sense: evacuation purges the body from all matter it cannot assimilate? So most recent commentators.

V. these words are in apposition with draught: the draught which makes pure the whole of the food, since it is the place designed for receiving the impure excrements.<p>Christ was enforcing the truth that all defilement comes from within. This was in the face of the Rabbinic distinctions between clean and unclean meats. Christ asserts that Levitical uncleanness, such as eating with unwashed hands, is of small importance compared with moral uncleanness. Peter, still under the influence of the old ideas, cannot understand the saying and asks an explanation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-15.htm">Matthew 15:15</a>), which Christ gives in <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18-23</a>. The words purging all meats (Rev., making all meats clean) are not Christ's, but the Evangelist's, explaining the bearing of Christ's words; and therefore the Rev. properly renders, this he said (italics), making all meats clean. This was the interpretation of Chrysostom, who says in his homily on Matthew: "But Mark says that he said these things making all meats pure." Canon Farrar refers to a passage cited from Gregory Thaumaturgus: "And the Saviour, who purifies all meats, says." This rendering is significant in the light of Peter's vision of the great sheet, and of the words, "What God hath cleansed" (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;), in which Peter probably realized for the first time the import of the Lord's words on this occasion. Canon Farrar remarks: "It is doubtless due to the fact that St. Peter, the informant of St. Mark, in writing his Gospel, and as the sole ultimate authority for this vision in the Acts, is the source of both narratives, - that we owe the hitherto unnoticed circumstance that the two verbs, cleanse and profane (or defile), both in a peculiarly pregnant sense, are the two most prominent words in the narrative of both events" ("Life and Work of Paul," i., 276-7). </body></html>
