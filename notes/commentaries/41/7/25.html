As she was a good woman, so a good mother. This sent her to Christ. His saying, Let the children first be filled, shows that there was mercy for the Gentiles, and not far off. She spoke, not as making light of the mercy, but magnifying the abundance of miraculous cures among the Jews, in comparison with which a single cure was but as a crumb. Thus, while proud Pharisees are left by the blessed Saviour, he manifests his compassion to poor humbled sinners, who look to him for children's bread. He still goes about to seek and save the lost.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this miracle explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-21.htm">Matthew 15:21-28</a>.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-24.htm">Mark 7:24</a><p>Would have no man know it - To avoid the designs of the Pharisees he wished to be retired.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.

All ages were liable to this incursion of unclean spirits. The woman seems to have come from a distance. She was a <span class="cmt_word">Greek</span> - that is, a Gentile - <span class="cmt_word">a Syro-phoenician by race</span>, as distinguished from the Libyan Phoenicians, of Carthage. She was a descendant from those seven nations of Canaan which had been driven out by God's command. They were called in their own language "Canaanites," <span class="cmt_word">And she besought him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>); <span class="accented">literally</span>, <span class="accented">asked</span> him. St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-22.htm">Matthew 15:22</a>) says that "she cried (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>), have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David." Aristotle says that "parents love their children more than their children love them; because love descends, and because parents desire that their children should survive them, that they may live on in their children, as it were, after death; that they become, so to speak, immortal through their children, and possess that eternity, which they cannot have in themselves, in their children and their children's children." St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-23.htm">Matthew 15:23</a>) tells us that at first "he answered her not a word," and he does not record the remarkable saying, Let the children first be filled, which in St. Mark precedes the words, <span class="cmt_word">it is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs</span>. Dogs abound in Palestine and the surrounding districts, but they are not cared for. They go about in packs, with no particular masters and no particular homes. They seem to be chiefly useful as scavengers. Nevertheless, the dog of the East is amenable to kindness shown him by man, and there, as in England, children and young dogs soon become friendly. It is of (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) "little dogs" that our Lord here speaks. Our Lord here speaks after the manner of the Jews, who called the Gentiles dogs, as distinguished from themselves, the children of the kingdom. <span class="accented">Let the children first be filled.</span> Suffer me first to heal all the Jews who need my help. Our Lord makes at first as though he would refuse her request; and yet it is not an absolute denial. There might be hope for her when the children were filled. Thus Christ oftentimes deals with holy souls, namely, by humbling and mortifying them when they desire anything at his hands, in order that with yet greater importunity and humility they may seek and obtain it. St. Chrysostom says, "Whether we obtain that which we seek for, or whether we obtain it not, let us ever persevere in prayer. And let us give thanks, not only if we obtain, but even if we fail to obtain. For when God denies us anything, it is no less a favor than if he had granted it; for we know not as he does what is most expedient for us." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Daughter (&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Diminutive.
