When many are deceived, we should thereby be awakened to look to ourselves. And the disciples of Christ, if it be not their own fault, may enjoy holy security and peace of mind, when all around is in disorder. But they must take heed that they are not drawn away from Christ and their duty to him, by the sufferings they will meet with for his sake. They shall be hated of all men: trouble enough! Yet the work they were called to should be carried on and prosper. Though they may be crushed and borne down, the gospel cannot be. The salvation promised is more than deliverance from evil, it is everlasting blessedness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Neither do ye premeditate - Do not think beforehand, or "prepare" an answer.

There could be no more explicit promise that they should be under an infallible guidance, and we are not left to doubt that they were taught of God. At the same time, this was a most desirable and gracious aid. They were illiterate, unknown, without power. They were unfit of themselves to make the important statements of religion which were requisite, but God gave them power, and they spake with a wisdom, fearlessness, pungency, and ability which no other men have ever manifested - full proof that these illiterate fishermen were under the influence of the Holy Spirit. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

Lk. has “I” here: Christ = the Holy Ghost. This comforting word is wanting in Mt., and whether it was really spoken at this time must remain uncertain. Mt. describes with more detail the internal troubles of the Christian community—mutual treachery, false prophets (within, not without, like the false Messiahs of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-5.htm" title="And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:">Mark 13:5</a>), lawlessness, chilling of early enthusiasm—all implying the lapse of a considerable time, and all to happen before the end of Jerusalem.
