The “stones” of Herod’s Temple (for it was to him chiefly that it owed its magnificence) were of sculptured marble. The “buildings,” or structures, included columns, chambers, porticos that were, as St. Luke tells us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-5.htm" title="And as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,">Luke 21:5</a>), the votive <span class= "ital">offerings</span> of the faithful. The disciples gazed on these with the natural admiration of Galilean peasants. In spite of the lesson they had just received—a lesson meant, it may be, to correct the tendency which our Lord discerned—they were still measuring things by their quantity and size. They admired the “goodly stones” more than the “widow’s mite.” They were now to be taught that, while the one should be spoken of throughout the whole world, the other should be destroyed, so that not a vestige should remain. We cannot say who spoke the words, but it is at least probable that it came from one of the four who are named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,">Mark 13:3</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/mark/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/13-1.htm" title="And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!...">Mark 13:1-2</a></span>. <span class="ital">See what manner of stones, </span>&c. — Our Lord, in the conclusion of his lamentation over Jerusalem, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/23-38.htm" title="Behold, your house is left to you desolate....">Matthew 23:38-39</a>,) had declared that the temple should never be favoured with his presence any more; a declaration which, doubtless, appeared very strange to the disciples, and affected them much. For which reason they stopped him as he was going away, and desired him to see what a fine, sumptuous building the temple was: insinuating, probably, that they were surprised to hear him talk of leaving it desolate, for that so rich and glorious a fabric ought not to be deserted rashly. <span class="ital">Jesus said, There shall not be left one stone upon another </span>— This superb building, which you behold, adorned with huge stones of great beauty, shall be razed to the very foundation. It seemed exceedingly improbable that any thing like this should happen in that age, considering the peace of the Jews with the Romans, and the strength of their citadel, which forced Titus himself to acknowledge that it was the singular hand of God which compelled them to relinquish fortifications which no human power could have conquered. Bishop Chandler justly observes, “That no impostor would have foretold an event so unlikely and so disagreeable.” — <span class="ital">Defence of Christianity, </span>pp. 472, 473. Add to this, that it was not usual with the Romans to destroy either the cities or the temples of the countries they conquered. And with regard to this temple, Josephus tells us, (<span class="ital">Bell., <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-9.htm" title="And he said to them, Full well you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.">Mark 7:9</a></span>,) that Titus having held a council of his generals, who were for burning the temple, declared that he would by all means save that edifice as an ornament to the empire. But God had determined and declared that it should be destroyed. Accordingly, the soldiers burned it without paying any regard to Titus’s orders.

The temple was constructed of white marble, and the blocks were of a prodigious size.

Christ's Prophecy of the Destruction of Jerusalem, and Warnings Suggested by It to Prepare for His Second Coming. ( = Mt 24:1-51; Lu 21:5-36).<p>Jesus had uttered all His mind against the Jewish ecclesiastics, exposing their character with withering plainness, and denouncing, in language of awful severity, the judgments of God against them for that unfaithfulness to their trust which was bringing ruin upon the nation. He had closed this His last public discourse (Mt 23:1-39) by a passionate lamentation over Jerusalem, and a solemn farewell to the temple. "And," says Matthew (Mt 24:1), "Jesus went out and departed from the temple"&#8212;never more to re-enter its precincts, or open His mouth in public teaching. With this act ended His public ministry. As He withdrew, says Olshausen, the gracious presence of God left the sanctuary; and the temple, with all its service, and the whole theocratic constitution, was given over to destruction. What immediately followed is, as usual, most minutely and graphically described by our Evangelist.<p>1. And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him&#8212;The other Evangelists are less definite. "As some spake," says Luke (Lu 21:5); "His disciples came to Him," says Matthew (Mt 24:2). Doubtless it was the speech of one, the mouthpiece, likely, of others.<p>Master&#8212;Teacher.<p>see what manner of stones and what buildings are here&#8212;wondering probably, how so massive a pile could be overthrown, as seemed implied in our Lord's last words regarding it. Josephus, who gives a minute account of the wonderful structure, speaks of stones forty cubits long [Wars of the Jews, 5.5.1.] and says the pillars supporting the porches were twenty-five cubits high, all of one stone, and that of the whitest marble [Wars of the Jews, 5.5.2]. Six days' battering at the walls, during the siege, made no impression upon them [Wars of the Jews, 6.4.1]. Some of the under-building, yet remaining, and other works, are probably as old as the first temple.<span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-1.htm" title="And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!">Mark 13:1</a>,2</span> Christ foretells the destruction of the temple,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/13-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,...">Mark 13:3-23</a></span> shows what signs and calamities should go before,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/13-24.htm" title="But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,...">Mark 13:24-31</a></span> and what should happen at the time of his coming,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/13-32.htm" title="But of that day and that hour knows no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father....">Mark 13:32-37</a></span> no man knoweth the day or hour; we must therefore<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>watch and pray, that we may not be found unprepared.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ver. 1,2.

It is most probable that he left the temple by the golden gate on the east, from whence the view of the temple would be particularly striking. We learn from St. Matthew (24.) that our Lord had just been predicting the fall of Jerusalem. It was, therefore, natural for the disciples to call his attention at that moment to the grandeur and beauty of the building and its surroundings. The temple at Jerusalem was one of the wonders of the world. Josephus says that it wanted nothing that the eye and the mind could admire. It shone with a fiery splendor; so that when  the eye gazed upon it, it turned away as from the rays of the sun. The size of the foundation-stones was enormous. Josephus speaks of some of the stones as forty-five cubits in length, five in height, and six in breadth. One of the foundation-stones, measured in recent times, proved to be nearly twenty-four feet in length, by four feet in depth. But all this magnificence had no effect upon our Lord, who only repeated the sentence of its downfall <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Stones<p>The spring-stones of the arches of the bridge which spanned the valley of Tyropoeon (the cheese-makers), and connected the ancient city of David with the royal porch of the temple, measured twenty-four feet in length by six in thickness. Yet these were by no means the largest in the masonry of the temple. Both at the southeastern and southwestern angles stones have been found measuring from twenty to forty feet long, and weighing above one hundred tons (Edersheim, "Temple"). </body></html>
