But as the passage describes what was to happen about the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, it cannot be applied to Barchochebas, who arose in the reign of Adrian, about sixty years after. Josephus (<span class="ital">Antiq., </span>20:6) tells us, that under the government of Felix, “the whole country was full of magicians who deceived the people.” In the same chapter, he says, “The magicians and deceivers persuaded the common people to follow them into the wilderness, promising to show them evident signs and miracles.” It seems these impostors pretended that the miracles they were going to perform, were those which God had predicted the Messiah would perform; perhaps they assumed the title directly, though Josephus, after the destruction of his nation, was ashamed to make any mention of the Messiah at all, or of the prophecies relating to him. After the example of Moses, these false Christs appealed to the miracles which they promised to perform, in proof of their being sent to deliver the nation from slavery. This appears evidently from a passage of his <span class="ital">Jewish War, </span>(ii. 12,) where, speaking of the affairs under Felix, he says, “Impostors and deceivers, under pretence of inspiration, attempting innovations and changes, made the common people mad, and led them into the wilderness, promising that God would there show them, <span class="greekheb">σημεια ελευθεριας</span>, <span class="ital">signs of liberty;</span>” that is, miracles in proof that they should be delivered from the Roman yoke, and obtain their liberty. This was the benefit the nation expected from the Messiah; and those deceivers who promised it to them were readily believed: for the common people daily expected that the Messiah would put them in possession of universal empire. Every impostor, therefore, who assumed that character, and promised them deliverance, was quickly followed and obeyed. Hence the propriety of Josephus’s observation. The same historian, <span class="ital">Antiq., </span>20:6, mentions an Egyptian Jew, calling himself a prophet, who persuaded the people to go with him to the mount of Olives, promising to show them from that place the walls of Jerusalem falling down, and giving them an entrance into the city. He speaks of this deceiver likewise, <span class="ital">Bell. Jud., </span>2:12, as “gathering together thirty thousand men on the mount of Olives, proposing to go thence and take Jerusalem by force, to drive out the Roman garrison, and rule over the people.” Here this impostor plainly acted the Messiah. But Felix, getting notice of his designs, came out and routed him. <span class="ital">And shall show signs and wonders to seduce, if possible, even the elect </span>— This relates especially to those impostors who appeared during the time of the siege, of which see Josephus, <span class="ital">Bell. Jud., </span>6:5; and Eusebius, <span class="ital">Hist. Ecclesiastes, </span>4:6. As for the objection which is urged from this text against admitting miracles as a proof of doctrines, two things may be here transiently observed: “1st, That it cannot certainly be proved that the works here referred to were true miracles: they might be like the <span class="ital">lying powers, signs, and wonders, </span>mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>. Or, 2d, That if we should, for argument’s sake, grant them to be real miracles, yet they are supposed to be wrought at a time when there were in the Christian Church teachers endued with superior miraculous powers. But it can never be inferred from such a supposition in that case, that God will suffer miracles to be wrought in proof of falsehood, when there are none of his servants to perform greater miracles on the side of truth. And when such superior miracles on the side of truth do exist, the opposite miracles, at most, can only prove that some invisible beings of great power, who are the abetters of falsehood, are strongly engaged to support the contrary doctrine; the consideration of which must excite all wise and good men to receive a truth so opposed with greater readiness, and to endeavour to promote it with greater zeal; as they may be sure the excellence and importance of it is proportionable to the solicitude of these malignant spirits to prevent its progress.” — Doddridge. <span class="ital">But take ye heed </span>— Be cautiously upon your guard against so dangerous an imposition: <span class="ital">Behold, I have foretold you all these things </span>— That, comparing the event with the prediction, your faith may be established by those very circumstances which, in another view, might have a tendency to shake it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:14-23 The Jews in rebelling against the Romans, and in persecuting the Christians, hastened their own ruin apace. Here we have a prediction of that ruin which came upon them within less than forty years after this. Such destruction and desolation, that the like cannot be found in any history. Promises of power to persevere, and cautions against falling away, well agree with each other. But the more we consider these things, the more we shall see abundant cause to flee without delay for refuge to Christ, and to renounce every earthly object, for the salvation of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the house-top - See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1-8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

The history of Josephus, and those Roman historians who wrote the history of those times that went immediately before the destruction of Jerusalem, and give us account of the taking of that city, are the best commentary on these verses. It hath been often said, that the Jews were in expectation of a Messias, and are so still. But by him they understood not a person who should be God man, and save his people from their sins, and set up a spiritual kingdom in the world, but a secular prince, who should come of the house of David, and restore them to their civil liberties. So that the name of Christ was a fair name to patronize any rebellious faction, where the leader would arrogate it to herself, especially if he could pretend to the house of David. Near the destruction of Jerusalem, several persons used these arts to draw people after them to defend themselves, and to stand up for their liberties. Our Saviour having discerned his disciples tinctured with this common error of the nation, and knowing what would come to pass, gives his disciples warning to avoid these delusions, and not to run after such pretenders, to their ruin and destruction. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And then if any man shall say to you,.... During those days of tribulation and affliction, or when shortened and at an end: <p>lo! here is Christ, or lo! he is there; the Messiah has appeared in such or in such a place, to deliver you from your national distresses and calamities, and from the Roman yoke and bondage: <p>believe him not; give no credit to such a report, for the reason following; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-23.htm">Matthew 24:23</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21, 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is the Christ; or, Lo, there, believe it not; for there shall arise false Christs and false prophets</span>. Josephus mentions one Simon of Gerasa, who, pretending to be a deliverer of the people from the Romans, gathered around him a crowd of followers, and gained admission into Jerusalem, and harassed the Jews. In like manner, Eleazar and John, leaders of the Zealots, gained admission into the holy place, under pretense of defending the city, but really that they might plunder it. But it seems as though our Lord here. looked beyond the siege of Jerusalem to the end of the world; and he warns us that as the time of his second advent approaches, deceivers will arise, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect. The word "to seduce" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> more properly rendered, as in the Revised Version, to lead astray. Every age has produced its crop of such deceivers; and it may be expected that, as the time of the end draws nearer and nearer, their number will increase. Sometimes those idiosyncrasies in them which show themselves in lying wonders, are the result of self-delusion; but still oftener they are deliberate attempts made for the purpose of imposing on the unwary. Sometimes they are a combination of both. In the cases to which our Lord refers there is evidently an intention to lead astray, although it may have had its origin in self-deceit. In our day there is a sad tendency to lead men astray with regard to the great fundamental verities of Christianity. And the words of St. Jerome may well be remembered here: "If any would persuade you that Christ is to be found in the wilderness of unbelief or sceptical philosophy, or in the secret chambers of heresy, believe them not." </body></html>
