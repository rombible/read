It may well have been at or near the very spot at which, a few days before, He had paused as “He beheld the city and wept over it” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-41.htm" title="And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,">Luke 19:41</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Peter and James and John and Andrew.</span>—The list of names is noticeable (1) as being given by St. Mark only; (2) as the only instance in which the name of Andrew appears in conjunction with the three who were on other occasions within the inner circle of companionship; (3) in the position given to Andrew, though the first called of the disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-41.htm" title="He first finds his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.">John 1:41</a>), as the last in the list.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/mark/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/13-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,...">Mark 13:3-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">As he sat upon the mount of Olives, over against the temple</span> — As this mountain stood eastward from the city, it must have been the eastern wall of the temple, fronting that mountain, which the disciples desired their Master to look at, and which, being built from the bottom of the valley to a prodigious height with stones of incredible bulk, firmly compacted together, made a very grand appearance at a distance. (Josephus <span class="ital">Antiq., <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-14.htm" title="Then Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.">Mark 15:14</a></span>; <span class="ital">Bell., <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-6.htm" title="And he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.">Mark 6:6</a></span>.) And in Mr. Mede’s opinion, this eastern wall was the only part of Solomon’s structure that remained after the Chaldeans burned the temple. Hence the portico, built on the top of it, obtained the name of <span class="ital">Solomon’s porch, </span>or portico, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-23.htm" title="And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.">John 10:23</a>. <span class="ital">Peter, James, &c., asked him privately </span>— When Jesus was come to the mount of Olives, and had taken a seat on some eminence, from whence the temple and a part of the city could be seen, these disciples, while the rest were at a distance on the road, or absent on some occasion or other, drew near to him and inquired privately, <span class="ital">when these things should be, and what should be the sign when they should be fulfilled? </span>See notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/24-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the world?...">Matthew 24:3-8</a>. <span class="ital">Many shall come in my name, </span>&c. — Christian writers have always, with great reason, represented Josephus’s History of the Jewish War as the best commentary on this chapter; and many have justly remarked it, as a wonderful instance of the care of Providence for the Christian Church, that he, an eye-witness, and in these things of so great credit, should (especially in such an extraordinary manner) be preserved, to transmit to us a collection of important facts, which so exactly illustrate this noble prophecy in almost every circumstance. Compare <span class="ital">Bell., <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-8.htm" title="And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came to him.">Mark 3:8</a></span>, al. 14. <span class="ital">There shall be famines and troubles </span>— Matthew says, <span class="ital">famines and pestilences. </span>Concerning these Josephus writes thus: (<span class="ital">Bell., <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-17.htm" title="And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.">Mark 7:17</a></span> :) “Being assembled together from all parts to the feast of unleavened bread, presently and on a sudden they were environed with war. And first of all a plague fell among them, by reason of the straitness of the place, and immediately after a famine worse than it.” Besides, in the progress of the siege, the number of the dead, and the stench arising from their unburied carcasses, must have infected the air, and occasioned pestilence. For Josephus tells us, (<span class="ital">Bell., 6. fine,</span>) that there were no fewer than six hundred thousand dead bodies carried out of the city, and suffered to lie unburied. <span class="ital">All these are the beginning of sorrows </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">ωδινων</span>. The expression properly signifies the pains of child-bearing, which at the beginning are but light in comparison of what they become afterward. Therefore our Lord’s meaning was, that the evils which he mentioned were but small in comparison of those which were yet to fall upon the nation.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:1-4 See how little Christ values outward pomp, where there is not real purity of heart. He looks with pity upon the ruin of precious souls, and weeps over them, but we do not find him look with pity upon the ruin of a fine house.

Matthew puts two things more into the question, <span class="ital">What</span> <span class="ital">shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?</span> The best of men have a great curiosity to know futurities, things that shall hereafter come to pass. All the other part of this chapter is spent by our Saviour in an answer to these three questions, according to St. Matthew, or this one question, according to Mark and Luke. Some have attempted curiously to distinguish betwixt the signs intended by our Saviour, as relating to each period. But certainly those interpreters do judge best, that think our Saviour intended to let them know, that the destruction of Jerusalem should be a type of the destruction of the world at the last day, and that the same things should go before the one, and be signs of it, that should go before the other. And whoso readeth the history of Josephus, of what happened before the destruction of Jerusalem, and after this time, will find that there were few or none of these signs, that are here mentioned, but came to pass before the dreadful destruction of that so famous place; yet we must doubtless look for many, if not all, the same things to come to pass before the general destruction of the world in the last day. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And as he sat upon the Mount of Olives,....

St. Mark, going more into detail, gives the names of those who thus asked him; namely, Peter and James and John, already distinguished, and Andrew, who enjoyed the distinction of having been the first called. These men appear to have been our Lord's inner council; and they asked him (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) privately, or <span class="accented">separately</span>, not only from the multitude, but from the rest of the disciples. It was a dangerous thing to speak of the destruction of the temple, or even to inquire about such an event, for fear of the scribes and Pharisees. It was this accusation that led to the stoning of Stephen. It is evident from St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a>) that the disciples closely associated together the destruction of the temple and his final coming at the end of the world. They knew from our Lord's words that the destruction of Jerusalem was near at hand, and therefore they thought that the destruction of the world itself, and the day of judgment, were also near at hand.
