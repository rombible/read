But we must go deeper than that to find its occasion. It was not because Jesus may have seen a sower in a field which had these three varieties of soil that He spoke, but because He saw the frivolous crowd gathered to hear His words. The sad, grave description of the threefold kinds of vainly-sown ground is the transcript of His clear and sorrowful insight into the real worth of the enthusiasm of the eager listeners on the beach. He was under no illusions about it; and, in this parable, He seeks to warn His disciples against expecting much from it, and to bring its subjects to a soberer estimate of what His word required of them. The full force and pathos of the parable is felt only when it is regarded as the expression of our Lord’s keen consciousness of His wasted words. This passage falls into two parts-Christ’s explanation of the reasons for His use of parables, and His interpretation of the parable itself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Christ was the centre of three circles: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The outermost consisting of the fluctuating masses of merely curious hearers; the second, of true but somewhat loosely attached disciples, whom Mark here calls ‘they that were about Him’; and the innermost, the twelve. The two latter appear, in our first verse, as asking further instruction as to ‘the parable,’ a phrase which includes both parts of Christ’s answer. The statement of His reason for the use of parables is startling. It sounds as if those who needed light most were to get least of it, and as if the parabolic form was deliberately adopted for the express purpose of hiding the truth. No wonder that men have shrunk from such a thought, and tried to soften down the terrible words. Inasmuch as a parable is the presentation of some spiritual truth under the guise of an incident belonging to the material sphere, it follows, from its very nature, that it may either reveal or hide the truth, and that it will do the former to susceptible, and the latter to unsusceptible, souls. The eye may either dwell upon the coloured glass or on the light that streams through it; and, as is the case with all revelations of spiritual realities through sensuous mediums, gross and earthly hearts will not rise above the medium, which to them, by their own fault, becomes a medium of obscuration, not of revelation. This double aspect belongs to all revelation, which is both a ‘savour of life unto life and of death unto death.’ It is most conspicuous in the parable, which careless listeners may take for a mere story, and which those who feel and see more deeply will apprehend in its depth. These twofold effects are certain, and must therefore be embraced in Christ’s purpose; for we cannot suppose that issues of His teaching escaped His foresight; and all must be regarded as part of His design. But may we not draw a distinction between design and desire? The primary purpose of all revelation is to reveal. If the only intention were to hide, silence would secure that, and the parable were needless. But if the twofold operation is intended, we can understand how mercy and righteous retribution both preside over the use of parables; how the thin veil hides that it may reveal, and how the very obscurity may draw some grosser souls to a longer gaze, and so may lead to a perception of the truth, which, in its purer form, they are neither worthy nor capable of receiving. No doubt, our Lord here announces a very solemn law, which runs through all the divine dealings, ‘To him that hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, shall be taken away even that which he hath.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. We turn to the exposition of the parable of the sower, or rather of the fourfold soils in which he sows the seed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>A sentence at the beginning disposes of the personality of the sower, which in Mark’s version does not refer exclusively to Christ, but includes all who carry the word to men. The likening of ‘the word’ to seed needs no explanation. The tiny, living nucleus of force, which is thrown broadcast, and must sink underground in order to grow, which does grow, and comes to light again in a form which fills the whole field where it is sown, and nourishes life as well as supplies material for another sowing, is the truest symbol of the truth in its working on the spirit. The threefold causes of failure are arranged in progressive order. At every stage of growth there are enemies. The first sowing never gets into the ground at all; the second grows a little, but its greenness soon withers; the third has a longer life, and a yet sadder failure, because a nearer approach to fertility. The types of character represented are unreceptive carelessness, emotional facility of acceptance, and earthly-mindedness, scotched, but not killed, by the word. The dangers which assault, but too successfully, the seed are the personal activity of Satan, opposition from without, and conflicting desires within. On all the soils the seed has been sown by hand; for drills are modern inventions; and sowing broadcast is the only right husbandry in Christ’s field with Christ’s seed. He is a poor workman, and an unfaithful one, who wants to pick his ground. Sow everywhere; ‘Thou canst not tell which shall prosper, whether this or that.’ The character of the soil is not irrevocably fixed; but the trodden path may be broken up to softness, and the stony heart changed, and the soul filled with cares and lusts be cleared, and any soil may become good ground. So the seed is to be flung out broadcast; and prayer for seed and soil will often turn the weeping sower into the joyous reaper.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The seed sown on the trodden footpath running across the field never sinks below the surface. It lies there, and has no real contact, nor any chance of growth. It must be in, not on, the ground, if its mysterious power is to be put forth. A pebble is as likely to grow as a seed, if both lie side by side, on the surface. Is not this the description of a mournfully large proportion of hearers of God’s truth? It never gets deeper than their ears, or, at the most, effects a shallow lodgment on the surface of their minds. So many feet pass along the path, and beat it into hardness, that the truth has no chance to take root. Habitual indifference to the gospel, masked by an utterly unmeaning and unreal acceptance of it, and by equally habitual decorous attendance on its preaching, is the condition of a dreadfully large proportion of church-goers. Their very familiarity with the truth robs it of all penetrating power. They know all about it, as they suppose; and so they listen to it as they would to the clank of a mill-wheel to which they were accustomed, missing its noise if it stops, and liking to be sent to sleep by its hum. Familiar truth often lies ‘bedridden in the dormitory of the soul, beside exploded errors.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And what comes of this idle hearing, without acceptance or obedience? Truth which is common, and which a man supposes himself to believe, without having ever reflected on it, or let it influence conduct, is sure to die out. If we do not turn our beliefs into practice they will not long be our beliefs. Neglected impressions fade; the seed is only safe when it is buried. There are flocks of hungry, sharp-eyed, quick-flying thieves ready to pounce down on every exposed grain. So Mark uses here again his favourite ‘straightway’ to express the swift disappearance of the seed. As soon as the preacher’s voice is silent, or the book closed, the words are forgotten. The impression of a gliding keel on a smooth lake is not more evanescent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The distinct reference to Satan as the agent in removing the seed is not to be passed by lightly. Christ’s words about demons have been emptied of meaning by the allegation that He was only accommodating Himself to the superstition of the times, but no explanation of that sort will do in this case. He surely commits Himself here to the assertion of the existence and agency of Satan; and surely those who profess to receive His words as the truth ought not to make light of them, in reference to so solemn and awe-inspiring a revelation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The seed gets rather farther on the road to fruit in the second case. A thin surface of mould above a shelf of rock is like a forcing-house in hot countries. The stone keeps the heat and stimulates growth. The very thing that prevents deep rooting facilitates rapid shooting. The green spikelets will be above ground there long before they show in deeper soil. There would be many such hearers in the ‘very great multitude’ on the shore, who were attracted, they scarcely knew why, and were the more enthusiastic the less they understood the real scope of Christ’s teaching. The disciple who pressed forward with his excited and unasked ‘Master, I will follow Thee whithersoever Thou goest!’ was one of such-well-meaning, perfectly sincere, warmly affected, and completely unreliable. Lightly come is lightly go. When such people forsake their fervent purposes, and turn their backs on what they have been so eagerly pursuing, they are quite consistent; for they are obeying the uppermost impulse in both cases, and, as they were easily drawn to follow without consideration, they are easily driven back with as little. The first taste of supposed good secured their giddy-pated adhesion; the first taste of trouble ensures their desertion. They are the same men acting in the same fashion at both times. Two things are marked by our Lord as suspicious in such easily won discipleship-its suddenness and its joyfulness. Feelings which are so easily stirred are superficial. A puff of wind sets a shallow pond in wavelets. Quick maturity means brief life and swift decay, as every ‘revival’ shows. The more earnestly we believe in the possibility of sudden conversions, the more we should remember this warning, and make sure that, if they are sudden, they shall be thorough, which they may be. The swiftness is not so suspicious if it be not accompanied with the other doubtful characteristic-namely, immediate joy. Joy is the result of true acceptance of the gospel; but not the first result. Without consciousness of sin and apprehension of judgment there is no conversion. We lay down no rules as to depth or duration of the ‘godly sorrow’ which precedes all well-grounded ‘joy in the Lord’; but the Christianity which has taken a flying leap over the valley of humiliation will scarcely reach a firm standing on the rock. He who ‘straightway with joy’ receives the word, will straightway, with equal precipitation, cast it away when the difficulties and oppositions which meet all true discipleship begin to develop themselves. Fair-weather crews will desert when storms begin to blow.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The third sort of soil brings things still farther on before failure comes. The seed is not only covered and germinating, but has actually begun to be fruitful. The thorns are supposed to have been cut down, but their roots have been left, and they grow faster than the wheat. They take the ‘goodness’ out of the ground, and block out sun and air; and so the stalks, which promised well, begin to get pale and droop, and the half-formed ear comes to nothing, or, as the other version of the parable has it, brings ‘forth no fruit to perfection.’ There are two crops fighting for the upper hand on the one ground, and the earlier possessor wins. The ‘struggle for existence’ ends with the ‘survival of the fittest’; that is, of the worst, to which the natural bent of the desires and inclinations of the unrenewed man is more congenial. The ‘cares of this world’ and the ‘deceitfulness of riches’ are but two sides of one thing. The poor man has cares; the rich man has the illusions of his wealth. Both men agree in thinking that this world’s good is most desirable. The one is anxious because he has not enough of it, or fears to lose what he has; the other man is full of foolish confidence because he has much. Eager desires after creatural good are common to both; and, what with the anxiety lest they lose, and the self-satisfaction because they have, and the mouths watering for the world’s good, there is no force of will, nor warmth of love, nor clearness of vision, left for better things. That is the history of the fall of many a professing Christian, who never apostatises, and keeps up a reputable appearance of godliness to the end; but the old worldliness, which was cut down for a while, has sprung again in his heart, and, by slow degrees, the word is ‘choked’-a most expressive picture of the silent, gradual dying-out of its power for want of sun and air-and ‘he’ or ‘it’ ‘becometh unfruitful,’ relapsing from a previous condition of fruit-bearing into sterility. No heart can mature two crops. We must choose between God and Mammon-between the word and the world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There is nothing fixed or necessary in the faults of these three classes, and they are not so much the characteristics of separate types of men as evils common to all hearers, against which all have to guard. They depend upon the will and affections much more than on anything in temperament fixed and not to be got rid of. So there is no reason why any one of the three should not become ‘good soil’: and it is to be noted that the characteristic of that soil is simply that it receives and grows the seed. Any heart that will, can do that; and that is all that is needed. But to do it, there will have to be diligent care, lest we fall into any of the evils pointed at in the preceding parts of the parable, which are ever waiting to entrap us. The true ‘accepting’ of the word requires that we shall not let it lie on the surface of our minds, as in the case of the first; nor be satisfied with its penetrating a little deeper and striking root in our emotions, like the second, of whom it is said with such profound truth, that they ‘have no root in themselves,’ their roots being only in the superficial part of their being, and never going down to the true central self; nor let competing desires grow up unchecked, like the third; but cherish the ‘word of the truth of the gospel’ in our deepest hearts, guard it against foes, let it rule there, and mould all our conduct in conformity with its blessed principles. The true Christian is he who can truly say, ‘Thy word have I hid in mine heart.’ If we do, we shall be fruitful, because <span class="ital">it</span> will bear fruit in us. No man is obliged, by temperament or circumstances, to be ‘wayside,’ or ‘stony,’ or ‘thorny’ ground. Wherever a heart opens to receive the gospel, and keeps it fast, there the increase will be realised-not in equal measure in all, but in each according to faithfulness and diligence. Mark arranges the various yields in ascending scale, as if to teach our hopes and aims a growing largeness, while Matthew orders them in the opposite fashion, as if to teach that, while the hundredfold, which is possible for all, is best, the smaller yield is accepted by the great Lord of the harvest, who Himself not only sows the seed, but gives it its vitality, blesses its springing, and rejoices to gather the wheat into His barn.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/mark/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/4-10.htm" title="And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable....">Mark 4:10-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">When he was alone </span>— That is, retired apart from the multitude. <span class="ital">Unto them that are without </span>— So the Jews termed the heathen: so our Lord terms all obstinate unbelievers; for they shall not enter into the kingdom; they shall abide in outer darkness. <span class="ital">So that seeing they may see, and not perceive </span>— They <span class="ital">would </span>not see before; now they <span class="ital">could </span>not, God having given them up to the blindness which they had chosen.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-20 This parable contained instruction so important, that all capable of hearing were bound to attend to it. There are many things we are concerned to know; and if we understand not the plain truths of the gospel, how shall we learn those more difficult! It will help us to value the privileges we enjoy as disciples of Christ, if we seriously consider the deplorable state of all who have not such privileges. In the great field of the church, the word of God is dispensed to all. Of the many that hear the word of the gospel, but few receive it, so as to bring forth fruit. Many are much affected with the word for the present, who yet receive no abiding benefit. The word does not leave abiding impressions upon the minds of men, because their hearts are not duly disposed to receive it. The devil is very busy about careless hearers, as the fowls of the air go about the seed that lies above ground. Many continue in a barren, false profession, and go down to hell. Impressions that are not deep, will not last. Many do not mind heart-work, without which religion is nothing. Others are hindered from profiting by the word of God, by abundance of the world. And those who have but little of the world, may yet be ruined by indulging the body. God expects and requires fruit from those who enjoy the gospel, a temper of mind and Christian graces daily exercised, Christian duties duly performed. Let us look to the Lord, that by his new-creating grace our hearts may become good ground, and that the good seed of the word may produce in our lives those good words and works which are through Jesus Christ, to the praise and glory of God the Father.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-10.htm">Matthew 13:10-17</a>.

These words are merely intended to lead back in a lively manner, after the digression of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/4-11.htm" title="And he said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are without, all these things are done in parables:...">Mark 4:11-12</a>, to the point of the question at <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-10.htm" title="And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.">Mark 4:10</a>, the reply to which then begins at <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-14.htm" title="The sower sows the word.">Mark 4:14</a> with respect to that special parable. A reproach is by some found in the words (since unto you it is given, etc., <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-11.htm" title="And he said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are without, all these things are done in parables:">Mark 4:11</a>, it surprises me, that ye know not, etc.). See Fritzsche and de Wette, the latter accusing Mark of placing quite inappropriately in the mouth of Jesus an unseasonable reproach. But Mark himself pronounces decisively against the entire supposition of this connection by his <span class="greekheb">καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς</span>, whereby he separates the discourse of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-13.htm" title="And he said to them, Know you not this parable? and how then will you know all parables?">Mark 4:13</a> from what has gone before. If the assumed connection were correct, Mark must have omitted this introduction of a new portion of discourse, and instead of <span class="greekheb">οὐκ οἴδατε</span> must have used perhaps <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑμεῖς οὐκ οἴδατε</span>, or some similar link of connection with what precedes. Moreover, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-13.htm" title="And he said to them, Know you not this parable? and how then will you know all parables?">Mark 4:13</a> is to be read as one question (comp. Lachmann and Tischendorf), and in such a way that <span class="greekheb">καὶ πῶς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. still depends on <span class="greekheb">οὐκ οἴδατε</span> (comp. Ewald); not, as Fritzsche would have it, in such a way that <span class="greekheb">καί</span> indicates the consequence, and there would result the meaning: “Ye understand not this parable, and are ye to understand all parables?” But this would rather result in the meaning: Ye understand not this parable; how is it, consequently, possible that ye shall understand all parables? And this would be a strange and unmeaning, because altogether self-evident consequence. Usually <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-13.htm" title="And he said to them, Know you not this parable? and how then will you know all parables?">Mark 4:13</a> is divided into two questions (so, too, de Wette), and <span class="greekheb">πάσας</span> is taken as equivalent to: all the rest; but this is done quite without warrant, since the idea of <span class="greekheb">λοιπάς</span> would be precisely the point in virtue of the contrast which is assumed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">γνώσεσθε</span>] future, because the disciples were not aware how they should attain to the understanding of the whole of the parables partly delivered already (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-2.htm" title="And he taught them many things by parables, and said to them in his doctrine,">Mark 4:2</a>), partly still to be delivered in time to come.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The following interpretation of the parable, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/4-14.htm" title="The sower sows the word....">Mark 4:14-20</a>, is “so vivid, rich, and peculiar, that there is good reason for finding in it words of Christ Himself,” Ewald.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-15.htm" title="And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan comes immediately, and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.">Mark 4:15</a>. Observe the difference between the local <span class="greekheb">ὅπον</span> and the temporal <span class="greekheb">ὅταν</span>, in connection with which <span class="greekheb">καί</span> is not adversative (Kuinoel, de Wette), but the simple conjunctive and: The following are those (who are sown) by the way-side: then, when the teaching is sown and they shall have heard, cometh straightway Satan, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-16.htm" title="And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;">Mark 4:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὁμοίως</span>] in like manner, after an analogous figurative reference, in symmetrical further interpretation of the parable. Translate: And the following are in like manner those who are sown on the stony ground: (namely) those who, when they shall have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy; and they have not root in themselves, etc. It is more in keeping with the simplicity and vividness of the discourse not to take the <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐκ ἔχουσι</span> along with <span class="greekheb">οἵ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-18.htm" title="And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,">Mark 4:18</a> f. And there are others, who are sown among the thorns; these are they who, etc. If <span class="greekheb">ἀκούοντες</span> be read,—which, however, would arise more easily from the similar parallel of Matthew than <span class="greekheb">ἀκούσαντες</span> (B C D L <span class="greekheb">Δ א</span>, Tisch.) from the dissimilar one of Luke,—the course of events is set forth from the outset, whereas <span class="greekheb">ἀκούσαντες</span> sets it forth from the standpoint of the result (they have heard, and, etc.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὰ λοιπά</span>] besides riches: sensual pleasure, honour, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰσπορ</span>.] namely, into that place whither the word that is heard has penetrated, into the heart. The expression does not quite fit into the parable itself; but this does not point to less of originality (Weiss). De Wette wrongly observes that <span class="greekheb">εἰσπορ</span>. is probably an erroneous explanation of the <span class="greekheb">πορευόμενοι</span> in Luke.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-20.htm" title="And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirty times, some sixty, and some an hundred.">Mark 4:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> (not <span class="greekheb">ἕν</span>; see the critical remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-8.htm" title="And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.">Mark 4:8</a>) <span class="greekheb">τριάκοντα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is, it is true, so far out of keeping, that by retaining the numbers the discourse falls back from the interpretation into the figure; but the very repetition of the striking closing words of the parable, in which only the preposition is here accidentally changed, betokens the set purpose of solemn emphasis.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/4-10.htm" title="And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable....">Mark 4:10-12</a>. <span class="ital">Disciples ask an explanation of the parable</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/13-10.htm" title="And the disciples came, and said to him, Why speak you to them in parables?...">Matthew 13:10-17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/8-9.htm" title="And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?...">Luke 8:9-10</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-10.htm" title="And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.">Mark 4:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">κατὰ μόνας</span> (<span class="greekheb">ὁδούς</span> or <span class="greekheb">χώρας</span> understood), alone—<span class="greekheb">οἱ περὶ αὐτὸν</span>, those about Him, not = <span class="greekheb">οἱ παρʼ αὐτοῦ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-21.htm" title="And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.">Mark 3:21</a>), nor = the Twelve, who are separately mentioned (<span class="greekheb">σὺν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δωδ</span>.); an outer circle of disciples from which the Twelve were chosen.—<span class="greekheb">τὰς παραβολάς</span>, <span class="ital">the parables</span>, spoken that day. They asked Him about them, as to their meaning. The plural, well attested, implies that the parables of the day had a common drift. To explain one was to explain all.

These words do not appear in St. Matthew's account. He simply says that " the disciples came and said unto him." This must have been upon some other occasion. It could not have been when be was preaching from the boat; for St. Mark says, <span class="cmt_word">they that were about him with the twelve</span>. He is the only evangelist who notices this. We must not forget that, besides the twelve, there were seventy other disciples.
