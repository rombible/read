The proverb furnishes a good illustration of what has just been said as to our Lord’s method of presenting the same truth under different aspects. In the Sermon on the Mount it appears as the law of retribution, which brings pardon to those who pardon, judgment without mercy to those who show no mercy. Here the law works in another region. With the measure with which we mete our knowledge, God will. in His bounty, bestow more knowledge upon us. The old maxim, <span class= "ital">Docendo disces</span> (“Thou wilt learn by teaching”), becomes here more than the lesson of experience, and is one with the divine law of equity.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:21-34 These declarations were intended to call the attention of the disciples to the word of Christ. By his thus instructing them, they were made able to instruct others; as candles are lighted, not to be covered, but to be placed on a candlestick, that they may give light to a room. This parable of the good seed, shows the manner in which the kingdom of God makes progress in the world. Let but the word of Christ have the place it ought to have in a soul, and it will show itself in a good conversation. It grows gradually: first the blade; then the ear; after that the full corn in the ear. When it is sprung up, it will go forward. The work of grace in the soul is, at first, but the day of small things; yet it has mighty products even now, while it is in its growth; but what will there be when it is perfected in heaven!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Take heed what ye hear - Or, consider well what you hear.

Whoso considereth the connection of these words, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">with what measure ye mete, &c., </span> with the first words in the verse, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Take heed what ye hear, </span> and compares the former with the parallel texts, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-2.htm" title="For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged: and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again.">Matthew 7:2</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-38.htm" title="Give, and it shall be given to you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that you mete with it shall be measured to you again.">Luke 6:38</a></span>, will wonder what the force should be of the argument. For in both the parallel texts the latter words in this verse seem to be used as an argument to persuade them to justice and charity towards men, from the punishments of the violations of the law concerning them, by way of retaliation. Nor are there any sins so ordinarily as those of that kind so punished. But they can have no such force here, following those words, <span class="ital">Take heed what ye hear.</span> But, as I said before, there is nothing more usual than diverse applications of the same common saying, or proverbial expression. The saying is true, whether it be understood of men or of God, As we deal with God, so will God deal with us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Take heed what ye hear.</span> Luke saith, <span class="ital">how ye hear. Take heed what ye hear; </span> as much as, Take heed to what you hear, that you may receive the word not as seed by the way side, or in thorny or stony ground, but as in good ground. This seemeth rather to be the sense of our Saviour, than to give a caution by these words to men to examine what they hear, searching the Scriptures whether what they hear doth agree with them, though that also be the duty of all conscientious persons, as appeareth from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-11.htm" title="These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.">Acts 17:11</a></span> For saith our Saviour, God will deal with you as to his providence as you deal with him. If you allow the word of God but a little hearing, you shall reap from it heard little profit and advantage; this appeareth to be the sense from the following words. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And unto you that hear shall more be given; </span> that is, unto you that hear, so as you attend, understand, believe, hearken, and obey, God will give further knowledge of Divine mysteries. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">For he that hath, to him shall be given, &c.:</span> another general proverbial expression; <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-12.htm" title="For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whoever has not, from him shall be taken away even that he has.">Matthew 13:12</a>"</span>, <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-29.htm" title="For to every one that has shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that has not shall be taken away even that which he has.">Matthew 25:29</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said unto them,.... At the same time, though he had said what follows at another time, still continuing his discourse with his disciples: <p>take heed what you hear: diligently attend to it, seek to understand it, and lay it up in your minds and memories, that it may be of use to you in time to come, and you may be useful in communicating it to others: <p>with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you; a common proverb among the Jews, used on various occasions, and to different purposes; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-2.htm">Matthew 7:2</a>. Here it seems to intimate, that if the disciples carefully hearkened to what they heard from Christ, and studiously laboured to understand it, and faithfully dispensed it to others, in return, a larger measure, and greater degree of spiritual knowledge, would be bestowed upon them: for it follows, and <p>unto you that hear, shall more be given; that is, that hear so as to understand, keep, and make a good use of what they hear, more shall be communicated to them; they shall have an increase of knowledge in the doctrines of grace, and mysteries of the Gospel. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</span><p>(3) The more liberally that we share such gifts as God has given us with our brethren, the more bountiful God will be toward us.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/mark/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/4-24.htm" title="And he said to them, Take heed what you hear: with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you: and to you that hear shall more be given....">Mark 4:24-25</a>.

In our passage <span class="ital">the relation of heedfulness to the knowledge thereby to be attained</span> is described. Euthymius Zigabenus well says: <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ μέτρῳ μετρεῖτε τὴν προσοχὴν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ μετρηθήσεται ὑμῖν ἡ γνῶσις</span>, <span class="greekheb">τουτέστιν</span>· <span class="greekheb">ὅσην εἰσφέρετε προσοχὴν</span>, <span class="greekheb">τοσαύτη παραχεθήσεται ὑμῖν γνῶσις</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐ μόνον ἐν τῷ τοσαύτη παρασχεθήσεται ὑμῖν γνῶσις</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐ μόνον ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ μέτρῳ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ καὶ πλέον</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-25.htm" title="For he that has, to him shall be given: and he that has not, from him shall be taken even that which he has.">Mark 4:25</a>. Reason assigned for the foregoing <span class="greekheb">καὶ προστεθήσεται</span>. The application of the proverbial saying (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-12.htm" title="For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whoever has not, from him shall be taken away even that he has.">Matthew 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-29.htm" title="For to every one that has shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that has not shall be taken away even that which he has.">Matthew 25:29</a>) is: For if ye (through heedfulness) have become rich in knowledge, ye shall continually receive still larger accession to this riches (that is just the <span class="greekheb">προσ τεθήσεται</span>); but if ye (through heedlessness) are poor in knowledge, ye shall also lose even your little knowledge. Euthymius Zigabenus erroneously refers <span class="greekheb">δοθήσεται</span> only to the <span class="greekheb">γνῶσις</span>, and <span class="greekheb">ἔχῃ</span> to the <span class="greekheb">προσοχήν</span>.

Zig.). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-2.htm" title="For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged: and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again.">Matthew 7:2</a> the apothegm is applied to judging. Such moral maxims admit of many applications. The idea of measuring does not seem very appropriate here. Holtz. (H. C.) thinks <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-24.htm" title="And he said to them, Take heed what you hear: with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you: and to you that hear shall more be given.">Mark 4:24</a> interrupts the connection.—<span class="greekheb">προστεθήσεται</span> implies that the reward will be out of proportion to the virtue; the knowledge acquired to the study devoted to the subject. There shall be given over and above, not to those who hear (T. R., <span class="greekheb">τοῖς ἀκούουσιν</span>), but to those who think on what they hear. This thought introduces <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-25.htm" title="For he that has, to him shall be given: and he that has not, from him shall be taken even that which he has.">Mark 4:25</a>, which, in this connection, means: the more a man thinks the more he will understand, and the less a man thinks the less his power of understanding will become. “Whoso hath attention, knowledge will be given to him, and from him who hath not, the seed of knowledge will be taken.

Nay, you shall have a return in far more abundant measure. For thus the fountains, the more water they pour out below, so much the more do they receive from above. Here, then, is great encouragement to all faithful teachers of the Word, of whatever kind; that by how much they give to others in teaching them, by so much the more shall they receive of wisdom and grace from Christ; according to those words of the apostle, "He that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6</a>). </body></html>
