The Greek word here for “secret” is interesting as being the same as that which we find in our word “Apocrypha.” The term was, in the first instance, applied to books that were surrounded with the secrecy of a spurious sacred-ness, but were not publicly recognised in the Church as being of divine authority, and was then transferred to all books which, whether “spurious” or “secret,” wanted that recognition.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:21-34 These declarations were intended to call the attention of the disciples to the word of Christ. By his thus instructing them, they were made able to instruct others; as candles are lighted, not to be covered, but to be placed on a candlestick, that they may give light to a room. This parable of the good seed, shows the manner in which the kingdom of God makes progress in the world. Let but the word of Christ have the place it ought to have in a soul, and it will show itself in a good conversation. It grows gradually: first the blade; then the ear; after that the full corn in the ear. When it is sprung up, it will go forward. The work of grace in the soul is, at first, but the day of small things; yet it has mighty products even now, while it is in its growth; but what will there be when it is perfected in heaven!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There is nothing hid ... - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-26.htm">Matthew 10:26</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

Both Mark and Luke have it immediately after the parable of the sower, where it doth not seem to have the same sense as here. But more general proverbial common sayings may be variously applied to things, to which the common sense and import of them will agree. Some here apply them thus, There is nothing in the prophecies concerning me which shall not be manifested; which agrees with the sense of those who interpret the former verse concerning Christ, as if he had been giving a reason why he opened the parables to those that asked him of it. But those who interpret it to the sense which it beareth plainly, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-15.htm" title="Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it gives light to all that are in the house.">Matthew 5:15</a>,16</span>, make the sense thus; For though you may play the hypocrites, and under a profession of the gospel but hide the hypocrisy, lusts, and corruptions of your hearts, yet that mask will not hold always, there will come a day of judgment, which will manifest and discover all, and bring to light the hidden things of dishonesty. What we have <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-23.htm" title="If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.">Mark 4:23</a></span> is but a usual conclusion which our Saviour hath often made of any grave and important discourses. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For there is nothing hid,.... In these parables, and figurative expressions used by Christ, <p>which shall not be manifested, sooner or later, to his disciples: <p>neither was any thing kept secret; any doctrine of the Gospel, or mystery of the kingdom: <p>but that it should come abroad; it was designed to be published in all Judea, and afterwards, throughout the whole world, for the benefit of God's chosen ones, to their conversion, comfort, and edification: wherefore it becomes the ministers of the Gospel to keep back nothing that may be profitable to the churches, nor shun to declare the whole counsel of God; but faithfully dispense the mysteries of grace, and commend the truth to every man's conscience, without any fear of men, or dreading the effects and consequences of things: since nothing is declared in the word, or made known, but with a design to be published to others, to answer some divine end and purpose; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-26.htm">Matthew 10:26</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-22.htm" title="For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.">Mark 4:22</a>. Double statement of the law that the hidden is to be revealed; 1st, predictively: there is nothing hidden which shall not be revealed; 2nd, interpretatively, with reference to the purpose of the hider: nor did anything become concealed with any other view than that it should eventually come to manifestation.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπόκρυφον</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἀποκρύπτω</span>), here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-17.htm" title="For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.">Luke 8:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm" title=" In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.">Colossians 2:3</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ</span>: in effect = <span class="greekheb">εἴ μὴ</span> <span class="ital">nisi</span>, but strictly <span class="greekheb">ἐγένετο ἀπόκρυφον</span> is understood to be repeated after it = nothing becomes concealed absolutely, but it is concealed in order that, etc. This is universally true. Things are hid because they are precious, but precious things are meant to be used at some time and in some way. All depends on the time and the way, and it is there that diversity of action comes in. Christ’s rule for that was: show your light when it will glorify God and benefit men; the world’s rule is: when safe and beneficial to self.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-22.htm" title="For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.">Mark 4:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐ γὰρ ἐστί τι κρυπτὸν</span>—<span class="greekheb">οὐδὲ ἐγένετο ἀπόκρυφον</span>, <span class="ital">for there is nothing hidden—nor has anything become concealed</span>) There is a difference both in the verbs <span class="ital">is</span>, implying that it was so naturally, and <span class="ital">has become</span>, implying intentional concealment, and also in the nouns [adjectives] used; comp. <span class="greekheb">κρυπτὰ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm" title="Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>, and <span class="greekheb">ἀπόκρυφοι</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm" title=" In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.">Colossians 2:3</a>;[38] to which corresponds the difference which is made in the corresponding antithesis, between <span class="greekheb">φανερωθῇ</span>, <span class="ital">be manifested</span>, and <span class="greekheb">ἔλθῃ εἰς φανερὸν</span>, <span class="ital">come to be manifested;</span> the former referring to manifestation by constraint, the latter to manifestation of its own accord, when it is ripe for manifestation. Therefore the former sentence can be understood of what is bad, the second sentence of what is good. This axiom holds good of the things in nature, of the feelings and actions of men, whether good or bad, in a natural condition or in a spiritual condition; as also of the divine mysteries.—<span class="greekheb">ἐγένετο</span>, <span class="ital">has become</span> [“was kept,” Engl.

There is a great principle of the Divine operations here announced by our Lord. Much, very much, is now hidden from us, in nature, in providence, and in grace. But it will not always be hidden. In natural things more and more is revealed as science advances, and in providence and in grace the mysteries of the kingdom will one day, and at the fitting time, be laid open to all.
