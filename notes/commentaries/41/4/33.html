By his thus instructing them, they were made able to instruct others; as candles are lighted, not to be covered, but to be placed on a candlestick, that they may give light to a room. This parable of the good seed, shows the manner in which the kingdom of God makes progress in the world. Let but the word of Christ have the place it ought to have in a soul, and it will show itself in a good conversation. It grows gradually: first the blade; then the ear; after that the full corn in the ear. When it is sprung up, it will go forward. The work of grace in the soul is, at first, but the day of small things; yet it has mighty products even now, while it is in its growth; but what will there be when it is perfected in heaven!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Spake he the word - The word of God.

And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it&#8212;Had this been said in the corresponding passage of Matthew, we should have concluded that what that Evangelist recorded was but a specimen of other parables spoken on the same occasion. But Matthew (Mt 13:34) says, "All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables"; and as Mark records only some of the parables which Matthew gives, we are warranted to infer that the "many such parables" alluded to here mean no more than the full complement of them which we find in Matthew.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/mark/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 33,34. From hence we may gather that all the parables by which our Saviour instructed his hearers are not recorded by the evangelists, though many be, and some mentioned by one, some by two of them, which are not recorded by the other. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As they were able to hear it.</span> Christ disdained not to accommodate his style and method of preaching to his hearers’ capacity, neither will any faithful minister of Christ do it: he preacheth in the best style, language, and method, that preacheth best to the capacity, understanding, and profit of his hearers. Other preachers do indeed but trifle with the greatest work under heaven, and please themselves with their own noises. That he did not speak without a parable unto them, was: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That he might speak with the best advantage for their understandings and their memories, and have the greater influence upon their affections; for similitudes have these three advantages. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That he might discern who came to hear him with a desire to learn, and be instructed by him, by their coming to him to inquire of his parables. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For although some of his parables were plain, and easy to be understood, yet others of them were dark sayings, because the doctrine taught by them was more mysterious; conscientious hearers would therefore come to have the parables expounded to them; these, were those <span class="ital">disciples</span> mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-34.htm" title="But without a parable spoke he not to them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.">Mark 4:34</a></span>, to whom be was wont to expound the parables in or by which he taught the multitude. For other common hearers, their contenting themselves with a mere hearing a sound of words, which they did not understand, was a sufficient indication that they made no conscience of their duty, but were such to whom it was not <span class="ital">given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, </span> but such upon whom the prophecy of the prophet Isaiah was to be fulfilled, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-9.htm" title="But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.">Mark 6:9</a>,10</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And with many such parables,....
