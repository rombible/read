There are many things we are concerned to know; and if we understand not the plain truths of the gospel, how shall we learn those more difficult! It will help us to value the privileges we enjoy as disciples of Christ, if we seriously consider the deplorable state of all who have not such privileges. In the great field of the church, the word of God is dispensed to all. Of the many that hear the word of the gospel, but few receive it, so as to bring forth fruit. Many are much affected with the word for the present, who yet receive no abiding benefit. The word does not leave abiding impressions upon the minds of men, because their hearts are not duly disposed to receive it. The devil is very busy about careless hearers, as the fowls of the air go about the seed that lies above ground. Many continue in a barren, false profession, and go down to hell. Impressions that are not deep, will not last. Many do not mind heart-work, without which religion is nothing. Others are hindered from profiting by the word of God, by abundance of the world. And those who have but little of the world, may yet be ruined by indulging the body. God expects and requires fruit from those who enjoy the gospel, a temper of mind and Christian graces daily exercised, Christian duties duly performed. Let us look to the Lord, that by his new-creating grace our hearts may become good ground, and that the good seed of the word may produce in our lives those good words and works which are through Jesus Christ, to the praise and glory of God the Father.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the parable of the sower explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-1.htm">Matthew 13:1-9</a>.<p>See the parable of the sower explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-1.htm">Matthew 13:1-9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

This was a new system of teaching. For some months he had taught directly. But as he found that this direct teaching was met in some quarters with unbelief and scorn, he abandoned it for the less direct method of the parable. The parable (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>) is etymologically the setting forth of one thing by the side of another, so that the one may be compared with the other. The parable is the truth presented by a similitude. It differs from the proverb inasmuch as it is necessarily figurative. The proverb <span class="accented">may</span> be figurative, but it need not of necessity be figurative. The parable is often an expanded proverb, and the proverb a condensed parable. There is but one Hebrew word for the two English words "parable" and "proverb," which may account for their being frequently interchanged. The proverb (Latin) is a common sentiment generally accepted. The parable (Greek) is something put by the side of something else. Theologically, it is something in the world of nature which finds its counterpart in the world of spirit. The parable attracts attention, and so becomes valuable as a test of character. It reveals the seekers after truth, those who love the light. It withdraws the light from those who love darkness. <span class="cmt_word">And said unto them in his doctrine</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">in his teaching</span>, <span class="accented">n</span>amely, that particular mode of teaching which he bad just introduced; "he taught them" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>).
