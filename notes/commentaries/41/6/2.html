Is not this the carpenter? Our Lord Jesus probably had worked in that business with his father. He thus put honour upon mechanics, and encouraged all persons who eat by the labour of their hands. It becomes the followers of Christ to content themselves with the satisfaction of doing good, although they are denied the praise of it. How much did these Nazarenes lose by obstinate prejudices against Jesus! May Divine grace deliver us from that unbelief, which renders Christ a savour of death, rather than of life to the soul.

For it seems that it was on a weekday, or on one of the common days of the week, that he entered into the city, where he remained without making himself known, till the sabbath day came: and then <p>he began to teach in the synagogue; that is, at Nazareth; where he expounded the law and the prophets, and preached the Gospel: <p>and many hearing him were astonished. The Vulgate Latin adds, "at his doctrine"; and so it is read in Beza's most ancient copy: <p>saying, from whence hath this man these things? This skill of explaining Scripture, this doctrine which he teaches, and these miracles he is said to work? This question they the rather put, because they had known him from the beginning: he had lived long among them, and they knew he had not learnt of men, and therefore wondered how he came by such things as these: <p>and what wisdom is this which is given to him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands? which were but the other day employed in servile work, and mechanical operations. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing <i>him</i> were astonished, saying, From whence hath this <i>man</i> these things? and what wisdom <i>is</i> this which is given unto him, that even such <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> mighty works are wrought by his hands?</span><p>(a) The word signifies powers or virtues, by which are meant those wonderful works that Christ did which showed and set forth the virtue and power of his Godhead to all the world; Mt 7:22.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/6.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-2.htm" title="And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From where has this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given to him, that even such mighty works are worked by his hands?">Mark 6:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἤρξατο διδάσκειν</span>, etc.: Jesus did not go to Nazareth for the purpose of preaching, rather for rest; but that He should preach was inevitable; therefore, the Sabbath coming round, He appeared in the synagogue, and spoke.—<span class="greekheb">πόθεν τούτῳ ταῦτα</span>: laconic; comprehensive, vague question, covering the discourse just heard and all that had been reported to them about their townsman, with the one word <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span>: such speech, such wisdom (<span class="greekheb">τίς ἡ σοφία</span>), such powers (<span class="greekheb">δυνάμεις</span>, not wrought there), in such a well-known person (<span class="greekheb">τούτῳ</span>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/mark/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">he began to teach in the synagogue</span>] For his former visit here see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-6.htm" title="And the devil said to him, All this power will I give you, and the glory of them: for that is delivered to me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.">Luke 4:6</a> sq. The conduct of His hearers on this occasion did not betray the frantic violence exhibited at His first visit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">mighty works</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">powers.</span> This is one of the four names given by the Evangelists to the miracles which the Lord was pleased to work while incarnate here on earth. They are called:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="greekheb">α</span>) “<span class="ital">Wonders</span>,” a term never used alone, but always in conjunction with other names. They are continually styled “signs and wonders,” or “signs” or “powers” alone, but never “wonders” alone. By this word the effect of astonishment, which the work produces on the beholder, is transferred to the work itself. The word only occurs once in St Mark, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-22.htm" title="For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall show signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.">Mark 13:22</a>, and there it is in conjunction with “signs.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="greekheb">β</span>) “<span class="ital">Signs</span>,” as being tokens and indications of something beyond themselves, of the near presence and working of God, the seals and credentials of a higher power. The word is an especial favourite with St John, though in our Version “sign” too often gives place to the vaguer “miracle,” to the great detriment of the true meaning and force of the word. It occurs three times in St John, twice in St <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-17.htm" title="And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;">Mark 16:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-20.htm" title="And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.">Mark 16:20</a> alone, and once in conjunction with “wonders,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-22.htm" title="For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall show signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.">Mark 13:22</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="greekheb">γ</span>) “<span class="ital">Powers</span>,” that is of God, coming into and working in this world of ours. As in the “wonder” the effect is transferred and gives a name to the cause, so here the cause gives its name to the effect. The word occurs four times in St Mark: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-30.htm" title="And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?">Mark 5:30</a> (A. V. <span class="ital">virtue</span>), <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-2.htm" title="And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From where has this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given to him, that even such mighty works are worked by his hands?">Mark 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-14.htm" title="And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.">Mark 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-39.htm" title="But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.">Mark 9:39</a>. In our Version it is rendered sometimes “<span class="ital">wonderful works</span>” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-22.htm" title="Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name? and in your name have cast out devils? and in your name done many wonderful works?">Matthew 7:22</a>), sometimes “<span class="ital">mighty works</span>” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-20.htm" title="Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:">Matthew 11:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-14.htm" title="And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.">Mark 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-13.htm" title="Woe to you, Chorazin! woe to you, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.">Luke 10:13</a>), and still more frequently “<span class="ital">miracles</span>” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-22.htm" title="You men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the middle of you, as you yourselves also know:">Acts 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-11.htm" title="And God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul:">Acts 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-5.htm" title="He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:5</a>), thus doing away with a portion of its force.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="greekheb">δ</span>) “<span class="ital">Works</span>.” This is a significant term very frequently used by St John.
