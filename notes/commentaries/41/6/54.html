And no difficulties can hinder Christ's appearance for his people, when the set time is come. He silenced their fears, by making himself known to them. Our fears are soon satisfied, if our mistakes are set right, especially our mistakes as to Christ. Let the disciples have their Master with them, and all is well. It is for want of rightly understanding Christ's former works, that we view his present works as if there never were the like before. If Christ's ministers now could cure people's bodily diseases, what multitudes would flock after them! It is sad to think how much more most care about their bodies than about their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They knew him - They "recollected" Jesus, because he had been there before and worked miracles.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>54.

Some, no doubt, had known him before, he was now the general object of interest and attraction wherever he went. <span class="cmt_word">They began to carry about on their</span> <span class="cmt_word">beds</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>those that were sick, where they heard he was</span>. The original is very expressive (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="accented">where they heard</span>, <span class="accented">He is there.</span> But the best authorities omit <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Villages, or cities, or fields</span> (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">country</span>, where the pursuits of agriculture would be going on. <span class="cmt_word">They laid the sick in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the streets</span> (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) - literally, <span class="accented">market-places</span>; the proper rendering - <span class="cmt_word">that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment</span>. The border (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) means the" fringe" or "hem;" the garment was the outer robe worn over the tunic. <span class="cmt_word">And as many as touched him were made whole</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>); <span class="greek">&#x3a7;&#x3a7;&#x3a7;</span> might mean either "him" or "it," that is, "the border of his garment." But the difference is of little importance; for it was faith in those who touched which brought the healing virtue to the sick, whether they touched the Saviour himself or only his clothes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </body></html>
