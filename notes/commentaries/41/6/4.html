Is not this the carpenter? Our Lord Jesus probably had worked in that business with his father. He thus put honour upon mechanics, and encouraged all persons who eat by the labour of their hands. It becomes the followers of Christ to content themselves with the satisfaction of doing good, although they are denied the praise of it. How much did these Nazarenes lose by obstinate prejudices against Jesus! May Divine grace deliver us from that unbelief, which renders Christ a savour of death, rather than of life to the soul. Let us, like our Master, go and teach cottages and peasants the way of salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-54.htm">Matthew 13:54-58</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 6<p>Mr 6:1-6.

Experience tells us that familiarity breeds a contempt. Our Saviour (though there was a deeper cause) assigns this the cause why those of Nazareth paid him no greater respect. Unbelief in us bindeth the hands of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He could there do no mighty works, </span> he could not, not from a defect of power, but the exercise of Divine power is always regulated by wisdom, and in consistency with his wisdom he could do no mighty works there: for the end of our Saviour’s miracles being either to convert unbelievers to the faith of the gospel, or to confirm weak believers in it, he foresaw that the performing of miracles there would be without any saving effect, and suspended his miraculous power. Besides, he was highly provoked by their obstinate infidelity, and would not work great wonders amongst them; only be cures a few sick persons. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And he marvelled because of their unbelief:</span> his Divine doctrine was so convincing, and the fame of his glorious works done in places near them was so universal and credible, that there was just cause of his rational wonder that they did not believe. Though our Saviour left them in their infidelity, he did not leave his blessed work, going <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">round about the villages, teaching.</span> Still preaching appeareth to have been our Saviour’s great work, how light a thing soever some make of it. I cannot but observe how little reason men have to glory in or to trust to any external privileges: how little other aids and assistances, without the special influences of Divine grace, signify to the begetting of faith in unbelieving souls, and removing their prejudices against the doctrine of the gospel! Christ’s own country is as bad as any other. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But Jesus said unto them,.... The following proverb; <p>a prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house; the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-57.htm">Matthew 13:57</a>; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-57.htm">Matthew 13:57</a>. Only the phrase, "among his own kin", is here added: very probably some of those that made these reflections, were some distant relations of Joseph, or Mary; for as Jesus was now in his own country and city, and in his own native place, so among his kindred and relations; who envied his gifts and attainments, and objected to him his rise from that branch of their family, which was the most mean and abject. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.</span><p>(c) Not only has that honour taken from him which is rightly due to him, but also has evil spoken of him and his words are misrepresented.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/6.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-4.htm" title="But Jesus, said to them, A prophet is not without honor, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.">Mark 6:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς συγγενεῦσιν α</span>., among his kinsmen.

Prophets are commonly least regarded, and often most envied, in their own country. However unworthy may be the feeling, the inhabitants of a district, or members of a community, do not like to see one of themselves put above them, more especially a junior over a senior, or a man of humble origin over a man well born. But it should be remembered that God abhors the envious, and will withhold the wonders of his grace from those who grudge his gifts to others. The men of Nazareth, when they saw Christ eating, and drinking, and sleeping, and working at his trade, like others, despised him when he claimed respect and reverence as a Prophet, and especially because his relations according to the flesh were of humble condition; and Joseph more particularly, whom they supposed to be his real father, for they could not imagine or believe that he was born of a virgin, and had God alone for his Father. </body></html>
