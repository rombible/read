Christ notices the frights of some, and the toils of others of his disciples, and provides rest for those that are tired, and refuge for those that are terrified. The people sought the spiritual food of Christ's word, and then he took care that they should not want bodily food. If Christ and his disciples put up with mean things, surely we may. And this miracle shows that Christ came into the world, not only to restore, but to preserve and nourish spiritual life; in him there is enough for all that come. None are sent empty away from Christ but those who come to him full of themselves. Though Christ had bread enough at command, he teaches us not to waste any of God's bounties, remembering how many are in want. We may, some time, need the fragments that we now throw away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this narrative explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-32.htm">Mark 6:32</a><p>By ship - By a boat or a small vessel.<p>Privately - Without making their plan known.

And they departed into a desert place by ship privately&#8212;"over the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias," says John (Joh 6:1), the only one of the Evangelists who so fully describes it; the others having written when their readers were supposed to know something of it, while the last wrote for those at a greater distance of time and place. This "desert place" is more definitely described by Luke (Lu 9:10) as "belonging to the city called Bethsaida." This must not be confounded with the town so called on the western side of the lake (see on [1448]Mt 11:21). This town lay on its northeastern side, near where the Jordan empties itself into it: in Gaulonitis, out of the dominions of Herod Antipas, and within the dominions of Philip the Tetrarch (Lu 3:1), who raised it from a village to a city, and called it Julias, in honor of Julia, the daughter of Augustus [Josephus, Antiquities, 18.2,1].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/mark/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-31.htm" title="And he said to them, Come you yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.">Mark 6:31</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they departed into a desert place,....

Bethsaida-Julias was originally only a village, but was rebuilt and enlarged by Herod Philip not long after the birth of Christ. He raised it to the dignity of a town, and called it <span class="ital">Julias</span> after Julia the daughter of Augustus. Philip occasionally resided there, and there died and was buried in a costly tomb (Jos. <span class="ital">Antiq</span>. xviii. 4. 6). To the south of it was the green and narrow plain of <span class="ital">El-Batîhah</span>, “with abundant grass, and abundant space for the multitudes to have sat down” (Tristram’s <span class="ital">Land of Israel</span>, p. 439).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they went away in the boat</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">to a</span> <span class="cmt_word">desert place apart</span> - the boat, no doubt, which our Lord had ordered to be always in attendance upon him. We learn from St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-10.htm">Luke 9:10</a>) that this desert place was near to "a city called Bethsaida." It seems that there were two places called Bethsaida - one in Galilee proper, and the other to the north-east of the Sea of Galilee. It was to the neighborhood of this latter place that our Lord here directs the boat to take him. The other Bethsaida is mentioned lower down at Ver. 45. The word Bethsaida means the "fish village." </body></html>
