And no difficulties can hinder Christ's appearance for his people, when the set time is come. He silenced their fears, by making himself known to them. Our fears are soon satisfied, if our mistakes are set right, especially our mistakes as to Christ. Let the disciples have their Master with them, and all is well. It is for want of rightly understanding Christ's former works, that we view his present works as if there never were the like before. If Christ's ministers now could cure people's bodily diseases, what multitudes would flock after them! It is sad to think how much more most care about their bodies than about their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-22.htm">Matthew 14:22-36</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>47. And when even was come&#8212;the later evening (see on [1449]Mr 6:35). It had come even when the disciples embarked (Mt 14:23; Joh 6:16).<p>the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land&#8212;John says (Joh 6:17), "It was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them." Perhaps they made no great effort to push across at first, having a lingering hope that their Master would yet join them, and so allowed the darkness to come on. "And the sea arose" (adds the beloved disciple, Joh 6:18), "by reason of a great wind that blew."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/mark/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 47-52. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-24.htm" title="But the ship was now in the middle of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.">Matthew 14:24</a>"</span>, and following verses to <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-33.htm" title="Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth you are the Son of God.">Matthew 14:33</a></span>.

The time was not yet come when Christ would have his Divine nature fully revealed to them, and till he opened their eyes, and wrought in their hearts a full persuasion of that, it was not in their power so to apprehend it, as to give a full assent to it, and to act accordingly. This is that which is here called hardness or blindness of heart. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when even was come,.... The second evening, and it was properly night: <p>the ship was in the midst of the sea; of Galilee, about twenty five or thirty furlongs from the shore; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-19.htm">John 6:19</a>; <p>and he alone on the land; upon the mountain. This is observed, partly to show what distress the disciples were in, in the midst of the sea, having a hard gale of wind, and their master not with them; and partly to show that there was no way, humanly speaking, of Christ's getting to the ship, in order to go over; and is an illustration of the following miracle, of walking so many furlongs, as he must, upon the water, in a stormy, blustering night, to get to it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/mark/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">47</span>. <span class="ital">in the midst of the sea</span>] With all their efforts and the toil of the entire night they had not in consequence of contrary winds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-18.htm" title="And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.">John 6:18</a>) accomplished more than <span class="ital">five and twenty or thirty furlongs</span>, i. e. scarcely more than half of their way, the Lake being forty or forty-five furlongs in breadth, when one of the sudden storms, to which the Lake is subject, rushed down from the western mountains.
