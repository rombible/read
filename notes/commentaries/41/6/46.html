And no difficulties can hinder Christ's appearance for his people, when the set time is come. He silenced their fears, by making himself known to them. Our fears are soon satisfied, if our mistakes are set right, especially our mistakes as to Christ. Let the disciples have their Master with them, and all is well. It is for want of rightly understanding Christ's former works, that we view his present works as if there never were the like before. If Christ's ministers now could cure people's bodily diseases, what multitudes would flock after them! It is sad to think how much more most care about their bodies than about their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-22.htm">Matthew 14:22-36</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>46.

Both the evangelists desire to call attention to the fact that, when night came on, the disciples were alone in their boat and Jesus alone on the land. It was nightfall; and St. John informs us that "the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew." Then it was that the Lord left his place of prayer on the mountain, and walked upon the sea, that he might succor his disciples now distressed by the storm. It would appear that  our Lord had been obliged to use a little pressure to induce his disciples to leave him: "He constrained them (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46</span> <span class="cmt_word">- And when he had sent them away</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) - more literally, had taken leave of them, that is, the multitude - he departed into a mountain (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">literally, into the mountain</span>; that is, the high table-land at the foot of which the multitude had been fed.

Our Lord did this that he might teach us in our prayers to shun the crowd, and to pray in silence and in secret, with collected mind. There is here, too, a special example for the clergy, namely, this: that when they have preached they should go apart and pray that God would make effectual that which they have delivered; that he would himself give the increase where they have planted and watered, and renew their spiritual strength, that they may return again to their labour refreshed by communion with him. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>When he had sent them away (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., more correctly, after he had taken leave.
