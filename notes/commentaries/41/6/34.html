Christ notices the frights of some, and the toils of others of his disciples, and provides rest for those that are tired, and refuge for those that are terrified. The people sought the spiritual food of Christ's word, and then he took care that they should not want bodily food. If Christ and his disciples put up with mean things, surely we may. And this miracle shows that Christ came into the world, not only to restore, but to preserve and nourish spiritual life; in him there is enough for all that come. None are sent empty away from Christ but those who come to him full of themselves. Though Christ had bread enough at command, he teaches us not to waste any of God's bounties, remembering how many are in want. We may, some time, need the fragments that we now throw away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Much people ...as sheep ... - They had no one to teach them and guide them.

And Jesus, when he came out of the ship&#8212;having gone on shore.<p>saw much people&#8212;a great multitude.<p>and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd&#8212;At the sight of the multitudes who had followed Him by land and even got before Him, He was so moved, as was His wont in such cases, with compassion, because they were like shepherdless sheep, as to forego both privacy and rest that He might minister to them. Here we have an important piece of information from the Fourth Evangelist (Joh 6:4), "And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh"&#8212;rather, "Now the passover, the feast of the Jews, was nigh." This accounts for the multitudes that now crowded around Him. They were on their way to keep that festival at Jerusalem. But Jesus did not go up to this festival, as John expressly tells us, (Joh 7:1)&#8212;remaining in Galilee, because the ruling Jews sought to kill Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/mark/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> When Christ came out of the ship, on the other side of the water, he found that the people had outwent the ship; they were come about with a desire to hear the word. He considered what miserable priests and teachers they had, so that they were indeed as sheep without a shepherd, having none but such as were as bad or worse than none. Though he was weary, and came hither for some rest and repose, yet he will deny himself as to his bodily cravings, to do good to their souls: he first preacheth to them, and teacheth them many things; then he confirmeth his doctrine by a miracle, the relation of which followeth (see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/6-35.htm" title="And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came to him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:...">Mark 6:35-44</a></span>). <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jesus, when he came out,....

Christ observed, that they were hungering and thirsting after the word of righteousness, and had no faithful, spiritual pastors to feed them with knowledge and understanding; for the Scribes and Pharisees were blind guides, and shepherds that could not understand; so that the people were ready to perish for lack of knowledge, not having any spiritual comfort and refreshment under their ministry: hence they followed Christ, wherever he went, with great zeal and fervency, earnestly desiring the bread of life: this moved his compassion, so that though his view in coming to this place was retirement, and that his disciples might have some rest and refreshment, and might solace themselves in private conversation with him, and each other; yet postponing private advantage to public good, instead of reproving them for giving him this fresh trouble, kindly and tenderly received them: <p>and he began to teach them many things; relating to the kingdom of God, the Gospel dispensation, the doctrines and ordinances of it; things relating to their spiritual and eternal welfare, the comfort, and salvation of their immortal souls: and he dwelt long upon these subjects, because he found they were very ignorant, and needed instruction, and were very desirous of it; as well as healed all such of bodily diseases that stood in need thereof; of which Matthew only takes notice, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-14.htm">Matthew 14:14</a>; as Mark only of doctrine; but Luke mentions both doctrine and miracles of healing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-11.htm">Luke 9:11</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/6.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/6-34.htm" title="And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things....">Mark 6:34-44</a>. <span class="ital">The feeding</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/14-14.htm" title="And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick....">Matthew 14:14-21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/9-11.htm" title="And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing....">Luke 9:11-17</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/mark/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">34</span>. <span class="ital">he came out</span>] Comparing the account in the Fourth Gospel, we may conjecture that on landing the Lord and His disciples ascended the hill-side (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-3.htm" title="And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.">John 6:3</a>) and there waited awhile till the whole multitude was assembled.
