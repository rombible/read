Then aloud, as we may believe, the Holy One uttered His final warning to the Traitor, and pronounced words of immeasurable woe on him by whom He was about to be betrayed, “<span class="ital">It were good for that man if he had never been born</span>.” But the last appeal had no effect upon him. “<span class="ital">Rabbi, is it I?</span>” he inquired, steeling himself to utter the shameless question. “<span class="ital">Thou hast said</span>,” replied the Saviour, in words probably heard only by those close by, and gave him “the sop,” and Satan entered into him, as St John tells us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-27.htm" title="And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.">Mark 13:27</a>) with awful impressiveness. “<span class="ital">That thou doest, do quickly</span>,” the Saviour continued; and the traitor arose and went forth, and it <span class="ital">was night</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/13-27.htm" title="And after the sop Satan entered into him.

Existence is no blessing, but a curse, to him who consciously and wilfully defeats the purpose of his existence. St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-25.htm">Matthew 26:25</a>) here introduces Judas as asking the question, "Is it I, Rabbi?" And our Lord answers him affirmatively, "Thou hast said." This was probably said in a low voice. Had it been said so as to be heard by others, such as Peter and John, they might have risen at once to inflict summary vengeance upon the apostate traitor. </body></html>
