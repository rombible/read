The ointment made of it was used at baths and feasts as a favourite perfume. From a passage in Horace, it appears that this ointment was so valuable among the Romans, that as much as could be contained in a small box of precious stone was considered as a sort of equivalent for a large vessel of wine, and a proper quota for a guest to contribute at an entertainment, according to the ancient custom. Hor., lib. 4. ode 12. This author mentions the <span class="ital">Assyrian, </span>and Dioscorides the <span class="ital">Syrian nard; </span>but, it appears, the best is produced in the East Indies. “The root of this plant is very small and slender. It puts forth a long and small stalk, and has several <span class="ital">ears </span>or <span class="ital">spikes, </span>even with the ground, which has given it the name of <span class="ital">spikenard; </span>the taste is bitter, acrid, and aromatic, and the smell agreeable.” — Calmet. <span class="ital">She brake the box and poured it on his head </span>— As this spikenard was a liquid, and there appears to be no reason for breaking the box in order to get out the liquor, Knatchbull, Hammond, and some others maintain, that <span class="greekheb">συντριψασα</span>, the word here used, ought not to be translated <span class="ital">she brake, </span>but only that <span class="ital">she shook the box, </span>namely, so as to break the coagulated parts of the rich balsam, and bring it to such a degree of liquidity, that it might be fit to be poured out; and thus Dr. Waterland translates it. Dr. Doddridge and others, however, think the original word does not so naturally express this, and therefore imagine that the woman broke off the top of the vessel in which the balsam was contained. Dr. Campbell renders it, <span class="ital">She broke open the box, </span>observing, “I have chosen these words as sufficiently denoting that it required an uncommon effort to bring out the contents, which is all that the word here necessarily implies; and it is a circumstance that ought not to be altogether overlooked, being an additional evidence of the woman’s zeal for doing honour to her Lord. That the term ought not to be rendered <span class="ital">shook, </span>is to me evident. I know no example of it in this meaning in any author, sacred or profane. Verbs denoting <span class="ital">to shake, </span>frequently occur in Scripture. But the word is never <span class="greekheb">συντριβω</span>, but <span class="greekheb">τινασσω</span>, <span class="greekheb">σειω</span>, <span class="greekheb">σαλευω</span>.” Mr. Harmer understands it of the breaking the cement with which the vessel was closely stopped, a circumstance which, he thinks, appears natural, and an explanation which is justified by the phraseology of Propertius, a writer of the same age. <span class="ital">There were some that had indignation</span> — At this which the woman had done, being incited thereto by Judas; <span class="ital">and said </span>— Probably to the woman, <span class="ital">Why was this waste of the ointment made</span> — Of this rich and costly balsam? <span class="ital">And they murmured against her </span>— Spake privately among themselves against the woman, for what she had done. <span class="ital">But Jesus, </span>knowing every thing they spake or thought, <span class="ital">said, Why trouble ye her </span>— Without cause? <span class="ital">She hath wrought a good work on me — </span>Hath given a great proof of her firm faith, and fervent love to me; and therefore, instead of meriting your censure, deserves your commendation. <span class="ital">She hath done what she could </span>— To testify her affection for me. <span class="ital">She is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying </span>— Matthew, <span class="greekheb">προς το ενταφιασαι με</span>, <span class="ital">corpus meum ad funus componere, </span>to prepare my body for its burial. This vindication of the woman suggests the reason why Jesus permitted so expensive a compliment to be paid to him. Being desirous to impress his disciples with the thought of his death, he embraced every opportunity of inculcating it, whether by word or deed.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-11 Did Christ pour out his soul unto death for us, and shall we think any thing too precious for him? Do we give him the precious ointment of our best affections? Let us love him with all the heart, though it is common for zeal and affection to be misunderstood and blamed; and remember that charity to the poor will not excuse any from particular acts of piety to the Lord Jesus. Christ commended this woman's pious attention to the notice of believers in all ages. Those who honour Christ he will honour. Covetousness was Judas' master lust, and that betrayed him to the sin of betraying his Master; the devil suited his temptation to that, and so conquered him.

The Conspiracy of the Jewish Authorities to Put Jesus to Death&#8212;The Supper and the Anointing at Bethany&#8212;Judas Agrees with the Chief Priests to Betray His Lord. ( = Mt 26:1-16; Lu 22:1-6; Joh 12:1-11).<p>The events of this section appeared to have occurred on the fourth day (Wednesday) of the Redeemer's Last Week.<p>Conspiracy of the Jewish Authorities to Put Jesus to Death (Mr 14:1, 2).<p>1. After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread&#8212;The meaning is, that two days after what is about to be mentioned the passover would arrive; in other words, what follows occurred two days before the feast.<p>and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death&#8212;From Matthew's fuller account (Mt 26:1-75) we learn that our Lord announced this to the Twelve as follows, being the first announcement to them of the precise time: "And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings" (Mt 26:1)&#8212;referring to the contents of Mt 24:1-25:46, which He delivered to His disciples; His public ministry being now closed: from His prophetical He is now passing into His priestly office, although all along He Himself took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses&#8212;"He said unto His disciples, Ye know that after two days is [the feast of] the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified." The first and the last steps of His final sufferings are brought together in this brief announcement of all that was to take place. The passover was the first and the chief of the three great annual festivals, commemorative of the redemption of God's people from Egypt, through the sprinkling of the blood of a lamb divinely appointed to be slain for that end; the destroying angel, "when he saw the blood, passing over" the Israelitish houses, on which that blood was seen, when he came to destroy all the first-born in the land of Egypt (Ex 12:12, 13)&#8212;bright typical foreshadowing of the great Sacrifice, and the Redemption effected thereby. Accordingly, "by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working," it was so ordered that precisely at the passover season, "Christ our Passover should be sacrificed for us." On the day following the passover commenced "the feast of unleavened bread," so called because for seven days only unleavened bread was to be eaten (Ex 12:18-20). See on [1500]1Co 5:6-8. We are further told by Matthew (Mt 26:3) that the consultation was held in the palace of Caiaphas the high priest, between the chief priests, [the scribes], and the elders of the people, how "they might take Jesus by subtlety and kill Him."<span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-1.htm" title="After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.">Mark 14:1</a>,2</span> The chief priests and scribes conspire against Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/14-3.htm" title="And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she broke the box, and poured it on his head....">Mark 14:3-9</a></span> A woman pours precious ointment on his head.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-10.htm" title="And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him to them.">Mark 14:10</a>,11</span> Judas covenants to betray him,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/14-12.htm" title="And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said to him, Where will you that we go and prepare that you may eat the passover?...">Mark 14:12-21</a></span> Christ eats the passover, and showeth that one of his<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>disciples should betray him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/14-22.htm" title="And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body....">Mark 14:22-26</a></span> He institutes his last supper,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/14-27.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, All you shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered....">Mark 14:27-31</a></span> foretells the desertion of all his disciples, and<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Peter’s denial of him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/14-32.htm" title="And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he said to his disciples, Sit you here, while I shall pray....">Mark 14:32-42</a></span> His agony and prayer in the garden.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/14-43.htm" title="And immediately, while he yet spoke, comes Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders....">Mark 14:43-52</a></span> He is betrayed by Judas, and apprehended: his<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>disciples flee.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/14-53.htm" title="And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes....">Mark 14:53-65</a></span> He is carried before the council, falsely accused,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>examined, pronounced guilty and treated with indignity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/14-66.htm" title="And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there comes one of the maids of the high priest:...">Mark 14:66-72</a></span> Peter’s denial, and repentance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ver. 1,2.

That is, two days after Christ had delivered the foregoing discourse concerning the destruction of the temple at Jerusalem, was the feast of the passover; which was kept in commemoration of God's passing over the houses of the Israelites, when he destroyed the firstborn of Egypt, and made way for the deliverance of the children of Israel from thence: and which was kept by eating the passover lamb; and which, properly speaking, is the feast of the passover: <p>and of unleavened bread; which was the same feast with the other, called so from the unleavened bread which was then eaten; though with this difference, the passover lamb was only eaten on the first night, but unleavened bread was eaten for seven days together.

Disappointed as they had been in ensnaring Him into matter for a capital charge, they saw that their influence was lost unless they were willing to take extreme measures, and the events of the Triumphal Entry had convinced them of the hold He had gained over many of the nation, especially the bold and hardy mountaineers of Galilee. The only place where He appeared in public after the nights had been spent at Bethany was the Temple, but to seize Him there would in the present excited state of popular feeling certainly lead to a tumult, and a tumult to the interposition of Pilate, who during the Passover kept a double garrison in the tower of Antonia, and himself had come up to Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by craft</span>] It was formally resolved therefore to take Him <span class="ital">by craft</span>, and for this purpose to wait and take advantage of the course of events and of any favourable opportunity which might present itself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/14.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-1.htm" title="After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.">Mark 14:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸ πάσχα</span>, <span class="ital">the passover</span>) This is said in a strict sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-12.htm" title="And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said to him, Where will you that we go and prepare that you may eat the passover?">Mark 14:12</a>; for <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἄζυμα</span>, “the feast of <span class="ital">unleavened</span> bread,” is added.—<span class="greekheb">μετὰ δυὸ ἡμέρας</span>) That is to say <span class="ital">on the following day</span>.[1]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1] Two days before the Passover.—ED. and TRANSL.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now after two days was the feast</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the passover and the unleavened bread;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the passover and the unleavened</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>.
