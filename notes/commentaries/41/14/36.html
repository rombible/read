He began to be sorely amazed; words not used in St. Matthew, but very full of meaning. The terrors of God set themselves in array against him, and he allowed him to contemplate them. Never was sorrow like unto his at this time. Now he was made a curse for us; the curses of the law were laid upon him as our Surety. He now tasted death, in all the bitterness of it. This was that fear of which the apostle speaks, the natural fear of pain and death, at which human nature startles. Can we ever entertain favourable, or even slight thoughts of sin, when we see the painful sufferings which sin, though but reckoned to him, brought on the Lord Jesus? Shall that sit light upon our souls, which sat so heavy upon his? Was Christ in such agony for our sins, and shall we never be in agony about them? How should we look upon Him whom we have pierced, and mourn! It becomes us to be exceedingly sorrowful for sin, because He was so, and never to mock at it. Christ, as Man, pleaded, that, if it were possible, his sufferings might pass from him. As Mediator, he submitted to the will of God, saying, Nevertheless, not what I will, but what thou wilt; I bid it welcome. See how the sinful weakness of Christ's disciples returns, and overpowers them. What heavy clogs these bodies of ours are to our souls! But when we see trouble at the door, we should get ready for it. Alas, even believers often look at the Redeemer's sufferings in a drowsy manner, and instead of being ready to die with Christ, they are not even prepared to watch with him one hour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>&#x391;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;  Abba This word denotes "father."

St Peter could not fail to have treasured up the words of murmured anguish, which, “<span class="ital">about a stone’s throw</span>” apart, he may have caught before he was overpowered with slumber.

With the double letter at all events it has passed into the European languages, as an ecclesiastical term, ‘abbas,’ ‘abbot.’ See Canon Lightfoot on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm" title="And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.">Galatians 4:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Father</span>] St Mark adds this probably to explain the Aramaic word, after his wont.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/14.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-36.htm" title="And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to you; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what you will.">Mark 14:36</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀββᾶ ὁ πατὴρ</span>, <span class="ital">Abba Father</span>) Mark seems to have added <span class="ital">Father</span>, by way of interpretation: For Matthew, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-39.htm" title="And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as you will.">Matthew 26:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-42.htm" title="He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, your will be done.">Matthew 26:42</a>, says that what was said by Jesus was simply, “My Father:” Luke, ‘Father,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-42.htm" title="Saying, What think you of Christ? whose son is he?

Some commentators suppose that our Lord only used the Hebrew or Aramaic word "Abba," and that St. Mark adds the Greek and Latin synonym (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>) for the benefit of those to whom he was writing. But it is far more natural to conclude that St. Mark is here taking his narrative from an eye and ear witness, St. Peter; and that both the words were uttered by him; so that he thus, in his agony, cried to God in the name of the whole human family, the Jew first, and also the Gentile. We can quite understand why St. Matthew, writing to Jews, gives only the Hebrew word. All things are possible unto thee. Speaking absolutely, with God nothing is impossible. But the Deity is himself bound by his own laws; and hence this was impossible, consistently with his purposes of mercy for the redemption of the world. The Lord himself knew this. Therefore he does not ask for anything contrary to the will of his Father. But it was the natural craving of his humanity, which, subject to the supreme will of God, desired to be delivered from this terrible load. <span class="cmt_word">Remove this cup from me</span>. The "cup," both in Holy Scripture and in profane writers, is taken to signify that lot or portion, whether good or evil, which is appointed for us by God. Hence St. John is frequently represented as holding a cup. Howbeit, <span class="cmt_word">not what I will, but what thou wilt</span>. Our Lord has no sooner offered his conditional prayer than  he subordinates it to the will of God. St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>) here says, "Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done." Hence it appears that there was not, as the Monothelites taught, one will, partly human and partly Divine, in Christ; but there were two distinct wills, one human and the other Divine, both residing in the one Christ; and it was by the subjecting of his human will to the Divine that he wrought out our redemption. </body></html>
