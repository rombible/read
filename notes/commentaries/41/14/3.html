Do we give him the precious ointment of our best affections? Let us love him with all the heart, though it is common for zeal and affection to be misunderstood and blamed; and remember that charity to the poor will not excuse any from particular acts of piety to the Lord Jesus. Christ commended this woman's pious attention to the notice of believers in all ages. Those who honour Christ he will honour. Covetousness was Judas' master lust, and that betrayed him to the sin of betraying his Master; the devil suited his temptation to that, and so conquered him. And see what wicked contrivances many have in their sinful pursuits; but what appears to forward their plans, will prove curses in the end.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ointment - This word does not convey quite the proper meaning. This was a perfume. It was used only to give a pleasant odor, and was liquid.<p>Of spikenard - The "nard," from which this perfume was made, is a plant of the East Indies, with a small, slender stalk, and a heavy, thick root. The best perfume is obtained from the root, though the stalk and fruit are used for that purpose.<p>And she brake the box - This may mean no more than that she broke the "seal" of the box, so that it could be poured out. Boxes of perfumes are often sealed or made fast with wax, to prevent the perfume from escaping. It was not likely that she would break the box itself when it was unnecessary, and when the unguent, being liquid, would have been wasted; nor from a broken box or vial could she easily have "poured it" on his head.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

A place about two miles from Jerusalem, whither he retired after he had took his leave of the temple, and had predicted its destruction; a place he often went to, and from, the last week of his life; having some dear friends, and familiar acquaintance there, as Lazarus, and his two sisters, Martha and Mary, and the person next mentioned: <p>in the house of Simon the leper; so called because he had been one, and to distinguish him from Simon the Pharisee, and Simon Peter the apostle, and others; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6</a>; <p>as he sat at meat there came a woman; generally thought to be Mary Magdalene, or Mary the sister of Lazarus: <p>having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard; or "pure nard", unmixed and genuine; or liquid nard, which was drinkable, and so easy to be poured out; or Pistic nard, called so, either from "Pista", the name of a place from whence it was brought, or from "Pistaca", which, with the Rabbins, signifies "maste"; of which, among other things, this ointment was made. Moreover, ointment of nard was made both of the leaves of nard, and called foliate nard, and of the spikes of it, and called, as here, spikenard. Now ointment made of nard was, as Pliny says (w), the principal among ointments. The Syriac is, by him, said to be the best; this here is said to be <p>very precious, costly, and valuable: <p>and she brake the box. The Syriac and Ethiopic versions render it, "she opened it"; and the Persic version, "she opened the head", or "top of the bottle", or "vial": <p>and poured it on his head; on the head of Christ, as the same version presses it; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-7.htm">Matthew 26:7</a>. <p>(w) Nat.

The latter signification is here to be maintained: nard, <span class="ital">on which one can rely</span>, i.e. unadulterated <span class="ital">genuine</span> nard, as Eusebius, <span class="ital">Demonstr. ev.</span> 9, calls the gospel the <span class="greekheb">εὐφροσύνη τοῦ πιστικοῦ τῆς καινῆς διαθήκης κράματος</span> (where the contextual reference to the drinking lies not in <span class="greekheb">πιστικοῦ</span>, but in <span class="greekheb">κράματος</span>). The opposite is “<span class="ital">pseudonardus</span>” (Plin. <span class="ital">H. N.</span> xii. 12. 26), with which the genuine nard was often adulterated (comp. also Dioscor. <span class="ital">mat. med.</span> i. 6 f.). This is the explanation already given by Theophylact, Euthymius Zigabenus (both of whom, however, add that a special <span class="ital">kind</span> of nard may also be intended), and most of the older and more recent commentators (Lücke is not decided). But Eritzsche (following Casaubon, Beza, Erasmus Schmid, Maldonatus, and others of the older expositors quoted by Wolf, who deduce it from <span class="greekheb">πίνω</span>) derives it from <span class="greekheb">πιπίσκω</span>, and explains it as <span class="ital">nardus potabilis</span>. Certainly anointing oils, and especially oil of spikenard, were <span class="ital">drunk</span> mingled with wine (Athen. xv. p. 689; Lucian, <span class="ital">Nigrin.</span> 31; Juvenal, <span class="ital">Sat.</span> vi. 303; Hirtius, <span class="ital">de bell.

The <span class="ital">usus loquendi</span>, moreover, is decisive against all other explanations, such as that of the Vulgate (comp.

She offered up all, gave away all, and her “all” was a tribute worthy of a king. “To anoint the feet of the greatest monarch was long unknown; and in all the pomps and greatnesses of the Roman prodigality, it was not used till Otho taught it to Nero.” Jeremy Taylor’s <span class="ital">Life of Christ</span>, iii. 13.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/14.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-3.htm" title="And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she broke the box, and poured it on his head.">Mark 14:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πιστικῆς</span>, <span class="ital">genuine</span>) French <span class="ital">veritable</span> [So marg. of Eng.

This anointing of our Lord appears to have taken place on the Saturday before Palm Sunday (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1</a>).  The anointing mentioned by St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-36.htm">Luke 7:36</a>) evidently has reference to some previous occasion. The narrative here and in St. Matthew and St. John would lead us to the conclusion that this was a feast given by Simon - perhaps in grateful acknowledgment of the miracle which had been wrought upon Lazarus. He is called "Simon the leper," probably because he had been a leper, and had been healed by Christ, although he still retained the name of "leper," to distinguish him from others named Simon, or Simeon, a common name amongst the Jews. <span class="accented">There came a woman.</span> This woman, we learn from St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-2.htm">John 12:2, 3</a>), was Mary, the sister of Martha and Lazarus. The vessel, or cruse, which she had with her was made of alabaster, a kind of soft, smooth marble, which could easily be scooped out so as to form a receptacle for ointment, which, according to Pliny ('Nat. Hist.,' 13:3), was best preserved in vessels made of alabaster. The vessel would probably be formed with a long narrow neck, which could easily be broken, or crushed (the word in the original is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> so as to allow of a free escape for the unguent. The ointment was made of spikenard <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>). The Vulgate has <span class="accented">nardi spicati.</span> If this is the true interpretation of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, it would mean that this ointment was made from a bearded plant mentioned by Pliny ('Nat. Hist.,' 12:12), who says that the ointment made from this plant was most precious. The plant was called by Galen "nardi spica." Hence <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span> it would mean "genuine" ointment - ointment made from the flowers of the choicest kind of plant, pliny ('Nat. Hist.,' 12:26) says that there was an inferior article in circulation, which he calls "pseudo-nard." The Syriac Peshito Version uses an expression which means the principal, or best kind of ointment. The anointing of the head would be the more usual mark of honor. It would seem most probable that Mary first wiped the feet of Jesus, wetting them with her tears, and then wiping off the dust, and then anointing them; and that she then proceeded to break the neck of the cruse, and to pour its whole contents on his head. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/14.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Alabaster box<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-7.htm">Matthew 26:7</a>.<p>Spikenard (&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>The meaning of &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; greatly disputed.
