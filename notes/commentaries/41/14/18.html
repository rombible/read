But our Lord knows all things about us before they come to pass. If we admit him, he will dwell in our hearts. The Son of man goes, as it is written of him, as a lamb to the slaughter; but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed! God's permitting the sins of men, and bringing glory to himself out of them, does not oblige them to sin; nor will this be any excuse for their guilt, or lessen their punishment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-20.htm">Matthew 26:20-35</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 14:12-26.

(ii) Then followed the unseemly dispute touching priority (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/22-24.htm" title="And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest....">Luke 22:24-30</a>), to correct which and to teach them in the most striking manner possible a lesson of humility, He washed His disciples’ feet, covered with dust from their walk along the road from Bethany (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/13-1.htm" title="Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end....">John 13:1-11</a>). Then the meal was resumed and He reclined once more at the table (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-12.htm" title="So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said to them, Know you what I have done to you?">John 13:12</a>), the beloved disciple lying on His right, with his head close to the Redeemer’s breast.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">One of you which eateth with me shall betray me</span>] He had already said, after washing their feet, “now ye are clean, but <span class="ital">not all</span>” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-10.htm" title="Jesus said to him, He that is washed needs not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and you are clean, but not all.">John 13:10</a>), but at this moment the consciousness of the traitor’s presence so wrought upon Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-21.htm" title="When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you shall betray me.">John 13:21</a>) that He broke forth into words of yet plainer prediction.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Verily I say unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">you, One of you shall betray me, even he that eateth with</span> <span class="cmt_word">me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). Much had doubtless happened before our Lord said this; but St. Mark only records the important circumstances. These words of our Lord were uttered with great solemnity. The presence of the traitor was a burden upon his spirit, and cast a gloom over this usually joyous festival. A question here arises whether Judas remained to partake of the Holy Communion when our Lord instituted it. The greater number of the Fathers, and amongst them Origen, St. Cyril, St. Chrysostom, St. Augustine, and Bede, consider that he was present; and Dionysius says that our Lord's words to him, "That thou doest, do quickly," were intended to separate him from the rest of the twelve as one who had partaken unworthily; and that then it was that Satan entered into him, and impelled him onwards to this terrible sin. </body></html>
