Dr. Whitby thinks our translation of the words may be maintained; “for though Casaubon,” says he, “gave no instance of this signification of the word, Constantine proves, out of Philoponus, Dionysius, and Basil, that it signifies <span class="greekheb">κατανοειν</span>, <span class="ital">to consider of, </span>and <span class="ital">ponder, </span>or <span class="ital">fix the mind upon a thing. </span>So Eustathius; ‘the word <span class="greekheb">επιβαλλω</span>, respects either <span class="ital">the action, </span>and then it signifies exactly <span class="ital">to take it in hand, </span>or <span class="ital">the mind, </span>and then it signifies <span class="ital">to consider of it, </span>as we are able;’ or as Phavorinus interprets it, <span class="greekheb">επιβαλως νοειν</span>, aptly and wisely <span class="ital">to consider of it.” </span>Dr. Campbell, also, after a critical examination of the text, and of the different interpretations which learned men have given of it, says, “I think, with Wetstein, that the sense exhibited by the English translation is the most probable.” Dr. Macknight, however, gives it as his opinion, that the original expression should be rendered, <span class="ital">and throwing his garment </span>(that is, the veil which the Jewish men used to wear) <span class="ital">over his head, he wept; </span>“For the expression,” says he, “is elliptical, and must be supplied thus, <span class="greekheb">Επιβαλων ιματιον τη κεφαλη αυτου</span>, as is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-19.htm" title="You shall keep my statutes. You shall not let your cattle engender with a diverse kind: you shall not sow your field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woolen come on you.">Leviticus 19:19</a>, LXX. Besides, it was the custom of persons in confusion to cover their heads, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/14-3.htm" title="And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads....">Jeremiah 14:3-4</a>.” Thus also Elsner, Salmasius, Bos, and Waterland understand the words. It may not be improper to mention one more interpretation of the passage, adopted by Raphelius and some other learned critics, which is, <span class="ital">throwing himself out of the company, </span>namely, in a passionate manner, (which it is very probable he did,) <span class="ital">he wept. </span>This exposition, it must be acknowledged, makes Mark’s words agree in sense with those of the other evangelists, who say, <span class="ital">He went forth and wept; </span>and “plain it is,” says Dr. Whitby, “that in the book of Maccabees the word often signifies, <span class="ital">irruens, </span>or <span class="ital">se projiciens, rushing, </span>or, <span class="ital">casting one’s self out.”</span> <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:66-72 Peter's denying Christ began by keeping at a distance from him. Those that are shy of godliness, are far in the way to deny Christ. Those who think it dangerous to be in company with Christ's disciples, because thence they may be drawn in to suffer for him, will find it much more dangerous to be in company with his enemies, because there they may be drawn in to sin against him. When Christ was admired and flocked after, Peter readily owned him; but will own no relation to him now he is deserted and despised. Yet observe, Peter's repentance was very speedy. Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall; and let him that has fallen think of these things, and of his own offences, and return to the Lord with weeping and supplication, seeking forgiveness, and to be raised up by the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this fully explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-57.htm">Matthew 26:57-75</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>66. And as Peter was beneath in the palace&#8212;This little word "beneath"&#8212;one of our Evangelist's graphic touches&#8212;is most important for the right understanding of what we may call the topography of the scene. We must take it in connection with Matthew's word (Mt 26:69): "Now Peter sat without in the palace"&#8212;or quadrangular court, in the center of which the fire would be burning; and crowding around and buzzing about it would be the menials and others who had been admitted within the court. At the upper end of this court, probably, would be the memorable chamber in which the trial was held&#8212;open to the court, likely, and not far from the fire (as we gather from Lu 22:61), but on a higher level; for (as our verse says) the court, with Peter in it, was "beneath" it. The ascent to the Council chamber was perhaps by a short flight of steps. If the reader will bear this explanation in mind, he will find the intensely interesting details which follow more intelligible.<p>there cometh one of the maids of the high priest&#8212;"the damsel that kept the door" (Joh 18:17). The Jews seem to have employed women as porters of their doors (Ac 12:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/mark/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 66-72. All four evangelists give us an account of this history of Peter’s denial of his Master. We have considered what they all say, to complete the history, in our notes on <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/26-69.htm" title="Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came to him, saying, You also were with Jesus of Galilee....">Matthew 26:69-75</a></span>; to which I see no reason to add any thing but the observation, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. How contemptible means God often useth to take down our pride and self-confidences. Peter, a great apostle, is here humbled by the means of two maids. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. How naturally one sin draws on another. Peter first tells a lie, then to lying addeth swearing and cursing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. How necessary it is for those that would keep from sin to keep out of sinners’ company. <span class="ital">I am</span> (saith David) <span class="ital">a companion of them</span> <span class="ital">that fear thee, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-63.htm" title="I am a companion of all them that fear you, and of them that keep your precepts.">Psalm 119:63</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. How profitable words from God are for the time to come, though at present we find not the use and advantage of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. How different the sinnings of reprobates and saints are, as to the consequences and issues. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Judas sins, repents, and hangs himself; Peter goeth out and weepeth bitterly. Judas repented unto death; Peter repenteth unto life.

And he went out, and wept bitterly.">Matthew 26:75</a></span>. Thus far we have heard Christ’s trial before the ecclesiastical court of the Jews. Thus far what he said <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-33.htm" title="Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests, and to the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:">Mark 10:33</a></span> is made good.

Thus the two verbs that are negatived are far more closely connected (conceived under <span class="ital">one</span> common leading idea) than by <span class="greekheb">οὐκ</span> … <span class="greekheb">οὐδέ</span>.

So Tischendorf. Still the word on the whole is critically suspicious, although it is quite wanting only in B M, vss.: the addition of it was natural enough, even although the <span class="greekheb">λέγειν</span> here is not addressed again to Peter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἤρξατο</span>] graphic.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-70.htm" title="And he denied it again.

The second <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span> introduces a renewed address, and this, indeed, ensued on the part of those who were standing by. Hence it is not: <span class="greekheb">πάλιν ἔλεγον οἱ παρ</span>., but: <span class="greekheb">πάλιν οἱ παρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἔλεγον</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ γὰρ Γαλιλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἶ</span>] for thou art also a Galilean; i.e. for, besides whatever else betrays thee, thou art, moreover, a Galilean. They observed this from his dialect, as Matthew, following a later shape of the tradition, specifies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐπιβαλών</span>] not: coepit flere (Vulg. It. Goth. Copt. Syr. Euthymius Zigabenus, Luther, Castalio, Calvin, Heinsius, Loesner, Michaelis, Kuinoel, and others), as D actually has <span class="greekheb">ἤρξατο κλαίειν</span>, which certainly also those versions have read; expressed with <span class="greekheb">ἐπιβάλλειν</span>, it must have run <span class="greekheb">ἐπέβαλε κλαίειν</span>, and this would only mean: he threw himself on, set himself to, the weeping (comp. Erasmus and Vatablus: “prorupit in fletum;” see also Bengel); nor yet: cum, se foras projecisset (Beza, Raphel, Vater, and various others), since <span class="greekheb">ἐπιβαλών</span> might doubtless mean: when he had rushed away, but not: when he had rushed out,—an alteration of the meaning which <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-75.htm" title="And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said to him, Before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.">Matthew 26:75</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-62.htm" title="And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.">Luke 22:62</a>, by no means warrant;[172] nor yet: <span class="ital">veste capiti injecta</span> flevit (Theophylact, Salmasius, <span class="ital">de foen. Trap.</span> p. 272; Calovius, L. Bos, Wolf, Elsner, Krebs, Fischer, Rosenmüller, Paulus, Fritzsche, and others[173]), which presupposes a supplement not warranted in the context and without precedent in connection with <span class="greekheb">ἐπιβάλλειν</span>, and would, moreover, require the middle voice; neither, and that for the same reason, is it: <span class="ital">after he had cast his eyes upon Jesus</span> (Hammond, Palairet); nor: <span class="ital">addens</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">praeterea</span> (Grotius), which is at variance with linguistic usage, or <span class="ital">repetitis vicibus</span> flevit (Clericus, Heupel, Münthe, Bleek), which would presuppose a weeping as having already previously occurred (Theophrastus, <span class="ital">Char.</span> 8; Diodorus Siculus, p. 345 B). Ewald is linguistically correct in rendering: Breaking in with the tears of deep repentance upon the sound of the cock arousing him. See Polyb. i. 80. 1, xxiii. 1. 8; Stephani <span class="ital">Thes.</span>, ed. Hase, III. p. 1526; Schweighäuser, <span class="ital">Lex. Polyb.</span> p. 244 f. Thus we should have to conceive of a loud weeping, answering, as it were, to the cock-crowing. From a linguistic point of view Casaubon is already correct (<span class="greekheb">κατανοήσας</span>); then Wetstein, Kypke, Glöckler, de Wette, Bornemann (in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit.</span> 1843, p. 139), Buttmann, <span class="ital">neut. Gr.</span> p. 127 [E. T. 145]: <span class="ital">when he had attended thereto</span>, namely, to this <span class="greekheb">ῥῆμα</span> of Jesus, when he had directed his reflection to it. See the examples for this undoubted use of <span class="greekheb">ἐπιβάλλειν</span> with and without <span class="greekheb">τὸν νοῦν</span> or <span class="greekheb">τὴν διάνοιαν</span>, in Wetstein, p. 632 f.; Kypke, I. p. 196 f. The latter mode of taking it (allowed also by Beza) appears more in accordance with the context, because <span class="greekheb">ἀνεμνήσθη κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. precedes, so that <span class="greekheb">ἐπιβαλών</span> corresponds to the <span class="greekheb">ἀνεμνήσθη</span> as the further mental action that linked itself thereto, and now had as its result the weeping. Peter <span class="ital">remembers</span> the word, <span class="ital">reflects</span> thereupon, <span class="ital">weeps!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[172] </span>Lange: “<span class="ital">he rushed out thereupon</span>,” namely, <span class="ital">on the cock crowing</span> as the awakening cry of Christ. First a rushing out as if he had an external purpose, then a painful absorption into himself and weeping.… Outside he found that the cry went inward and upward, and now he paused, and wept.” A characteristic piece of fancy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[173] So also Linder in the <span class="ital">Stud. u.
