Those that are shy of godliness, are far in the way to deny Christ. Those who think it dangerous to be in company with Christ's disciples, because thence they may be drawn in to suffer for him, will find it much more dangerous to be in company with his enemies, because there they may be drawn in to sin against him. When Christ was admired and flocked after, Peter readily owned him; but will own no relation to him now he is deserted and despised. Yet observe, Peter's repentance was very speedy. Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall; and let him that has fallen think of these things, and of his own offences, and return to the Lord with weeping and supplication, seeking forgiveness, and to be raised up by the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this fully explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-57.htm">Matthew 26:57-75</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>69. And a maid saw him again&#8212;or, "a girl." It might be rendered "the girl"; but this would not necessarily mean the same one as before, but might, and probably does, mean just the female who had charge of the door or gate near which Peter now was. Accordingly, in Mt 26:71, she is expressly called "another [maid]." But in Luke (Lu 22:58) it is a male servant: "And after a little while [from the time of the first denial] another"&#8212;that is, as the word signifies, "another male" servant. But there is no real difficulty, as the challenge, probably, after being made by one was reiterated by another. Accordingly, in John (Joh 18:25), it is, "They said therefore unto him, &c.&#8212;as if more than one challenged him at once.<p>and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them&#8212;or, as in Mt 26:71&#8212;"This [fellow] was also with Jesus the Nazarene."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/mark/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-66.htm" title="And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there comes one of the maids of the high priest:">Mark 14:66</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And a maid saw him again,....

Yet the fact that Mt. makes it another obliges us to ask whether Mk.’s expression necessarily means the same person. Grotius, whom Rosenmüller follows, says <span class="greekheb">ἡ</span> may here, as occasionally elsewhere = <span class="greekheb">τις</span>. Of more weight is the suggestion that it means the maid on duty in that particular place, the forecourt (Schanz and Klostermann; the remarks of the latter specially worthy of notice). On first thoughts one might deem <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span> decisive as to identity, but (1) it is wanting in [140], and (2) its most probable position is just before <span class="greekheb">λέγειν</span>, and the meaning, that Peter was a second time spoken to (or at) on the subject of his connection with Jesus, not that the same person spoke in both cases. On the whole a certain element of doubt remains, which cannot be eliminated by exegetical considerations. In favour of one maid is the consideration that two able to recognise Peter is more unlikely than one. Yet the two might be together when they saw Peter previously, or the one might point him out to the other that night. In Mt.’s narrative the standers-by seem also to have independent knowledge of Peter. In Mk. the maid gives them information. On the whole, Mk., as was to be expected, gives the clearer picture of the scene.—<span class="greekheb">τοῖς παρεστῶσιν</span>, to those standing by; pointing to Peter, and speaking so that he could hear.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[140] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/mark/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">69</span>. <span class="ital">a maid saw him again</span>] Recognised at the porch, Peter seems to have returned once more towards the fire, and was conversing in his rough Galilean dialect with the soldiers and servants when, alter the lapse of an hour, another maid approached.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to them that stood by</span>] On this occasion she addressed herself to the bystanders, amongst whom was a kinsman of Malchus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-26.htm" title="One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, said, Did not I see you in the garden with him?">John 18:26</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/14.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-69.htm" title="And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.">Mark 14:69</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἡ παιδίσκη</span>, the maid [not as Engl.
