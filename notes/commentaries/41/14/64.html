They answered and said, He is guilty of death.">Matthew 26:66</a>, the translators follow the old English usage, and connect the word “guilty,” not as we now do, with the crime of which a man is convicted, but with the punishment to which he is liable.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:53-65 We have here Christ's condemnation before the great council of the Jews. Peter followed; but the high priest's fire-side was no proper place, nor his servants proper company, for Peter: it was an entrance into temptation. Great diligence was used to procure false witnesses against Jesus, yet their testimony was not equal to the charge of a capital crime, by the utmost stretch of their law. He was asked, Art thou the Son of the Blessed? that is, the Son of God. For the proof of his being the Son of God, he refers to his second coming. In these outrages we have proofs of man's enmity to God, and of God's free and unspeakable love to man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this fully explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-57.htm">Matthew 26:57-75</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>64.

Yet not absolutely all; for Joseph of Arimathea, "a good man and a just," was one of that Council, and "he was not a consenting party to the counsel and deed of them," for that is the strict sense of the words of Lu 23:50, 51. Probably he absented himself, and Nicodemus also, from this meeting of the Council, the temper of which they would know too well to expect their voice to be listened to; and in that case, the words of our Evangelist are to be taken strictly, that, without one dissentient voice, "all [present] condemned him to be guilty of death."<p>The Blessed One Is Now Shamefully Entreated (Mr 14:65).<p>Every word here must be carefully observed, and the several accounts put together, that we may lose none of the awful indignities about to be described.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/mark/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-53.htm" title="And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.">Mark 14:53</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Ye have heard the blasphemy,....

He had incurred the capital penalty. But though they thus passed sentence, they could not execute it. The right had been taken from them ever since Judæa became a Roman province. The sentence, therefore, needed confirmation, and the matter must be referred to the Roman governor.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 64.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They all condemned him to be worthy</span> <span class="cmt_word">of death</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>).
