The marginal readings give two conjectures. Yet another may be found in the idea that the word describes St. Peter’s action “casting himself down, he wept,” but there is not enough authority for any other interpretation to justify a change in the text.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:66-72 Peter's denying Christ began by keeping at a distance from him. Those that are shy of godliness, are far in the way to deny Christ. Those who think it dangerous to be in company with Christ's disciples, because thence they may be drawn in to suffer for him, will find it much more dangerous to be in company with his enemies, because there they may be drawn in to sin against him. When Christ was admired and flocked after, Peter readily owned him; but will own no relation to him now he is deserted and despised. Yet observe, Peter's repentance was very speedy. Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall; and let him that has fallen think of these things, and of his own offences, and return to the Lord with weeping and supplication, seeking forgiveness, and to be raised up by the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this fully explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-57.htm">Matthew 26:57-75</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>72. And the second time the cock crew&#8212;The other three Evangelists, who mention but one crowing of the cock&#8212;and that not the first, but the second and last one of Mark&#8212;all say the cock crew "immediately," but Luke (Lu 22:60) says, "Immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew." Alas!&#8212;But now comes the wonderful sequel.<p>The Redeemer's Look upon Peter, and Peter's Bitter Tears (Mr 14:72; Lu 22:61, 62).<p>It has been observed that while the beloved disciple is the only one of the four Evangelists who does not record the repentance of Peter, he is the only one of the four who records the affecting and most beautiful scene of his complete restoration (Joh 21:15-17).<p>  Lu 22:61:<p>  And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter&#8212;How? it will be asked. We   answer, From the chamber in which the trial was going on, in the direction   of the court where Peter then stood&#8212;in the way already explained. See on   [1516]Mr 14:66. Our Second Evangelist makes no mention of this look, but   dwells on the warning of his Lord about the double crowing of the cock,   which would announce his triple fall, as what rushed stingingly to his   recollection and made him dissolve in tears.<p>And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept&#8212;To the same effect is the statement of the First Evangelist (Mt 26:75), save that like "the beloved physician," he notices the "bitterness" of the weeping (Lu 22:62). The most precious link, however, in the whole chain of circumstances in this scene is beyond doubt that "look" of deepest, tenderest import reported by Luke alone (Lu 22:61). Who can tell what lightning flashes of wounded love and piercing reproach shot from that "look" through the eye of Peter into his heart!<p>  And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said unto him,   Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny Me thrice.<p>  Lu 22:62:<p>  And Peter went out and wept bitterly&#8212;How different from the sequel of   Judas' act! Doubtless the hearts of the two men towards the Saviour were   perfectly different from the first; and the treason of Judas was but the   consummation of the wretched man's resistance of the blaze of light in the   midst of which he had lived for three years, while Peter's denial was but   a momentary obscuration of the heavenly light and love to his Master which   ruled his life. But the immediate cause of the blessed revulsion which   made Peter "weep bitterly" (Mt 26:75) was, beyond all doubt, this   heart-piercing "look" which his Lord gave him. And remembering the   Saviour's own words at the table, "Simon, Simon, Satan hath desired to   have you, that he may sift you as wheat; but I prayed for thee, that thy   faith fail not" (Lu 22:31, 32), may we not say that this prayer fetched   down all that there was in that look to pierce and break the heart of   Peter, to keep it from despair, to work in it "repentance unto salvation   not to be repented of," and at length, under other healing touches, to   "restore his soul?" (See on [1517]Mr 16:7).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/mark/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-66.htm" title="And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there comes one of the maids of the high priest:">Mark 14:66</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the second time the cock crew,.... Immediately, as soon as he had so said and swore, as the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions read, and as it is read in one of Beza's copies; which was about three of the clock in the morning, and is what is properly called the cock crowing: <p>and Peter called to mind; upon hearing the cock crow a second time, <p>the word that Jesus said unto him, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice: as he now had done twice, to the maid or maids, and a third time to the servants that stood by the fire along with him: <p>and when he thought thereon; on the words of Christ, and on his sin in denying him, and on the aggravated circumstances of it. The Arabic version renders it, "he turned himself to weep"; he turned away from the company, he threw himself out of it, and got out of doors as fast as he could, and broke out into a violent fit of weeping. The Syriac, Persic, and Vulgate Latin versions, render it, "he began to weep"; this phrase is omitted in the Ethiopic version: some choose to render it, "he looked upon him", that is, on Christ: as Christ looked upon him; which produced true evangelical repentance in him, so Peter looked upon his dear Lord with concern, whom he so had shamefully denied; he looked upon him and mourned, he looked upon him with an eye of faith, and sorrowed for his sin after a godly sort: but the true sense of the word is, "he covered himself"; he cast his garment over his head, he veiled himself as mourners did, who covered their heads, and their faces, and even their lips. So Maimonides (o); <p>"from whence, says he, is uncovering the head, forbidden a mourner? For, lo! it is said to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17</a>, "cover not thy lips" at all, for the rest of mourners are obliged to the covering of the head; the linen cloth, or veil, with which he covers his head, he covers with a part of it, a little over his mouth; as it is said, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>, "He shall put a covering upon his upper lip": and Onkelos paraphrases it, , "as a mourner he shall cover himself".'' <p>And so it is said of Haman (p), <p>"that he went to his house, and mourned for his daughter,   , "and put a covering on his head as a mourner": for his daughter, and for his reproach.'' <p>And this, it seems, was the custom of the Ishmaelites: hence that saying (q), <p>"all veiling (in mourning) which is not as the veiling of the Ishmaelites (who cover all the face), is no veiling?'' <p>And thus Peter, through shame, and as a token of sorrow and mourning for his sin, threw his garment over him: <p>and he wept; as Matthew says, "bitterly": being fully convinced of his sin, and heartily sorry lot it; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-75.htm">Matthew 26:75</a>. <p>(o) Hilch.

Most modern interpreters adopt the rendering in the A. V[143] and R. V[144], “when he thought thereon” (<span class="greekheb">ἐπιβαλὼν τὸν νοῦν</span>). Weizsäcker: “er bedachte es und weinte”. Theophylact took <span class="greekheb">ἐπιβ</span> = <span class="greekheb">ἐπικαλυψάμενος τὴν κεφαλήν</span>, having covered his head (that he might weep unrestrainedly), a rendering which Fritzsche and Field (<span class="ital">Otium Nor.</span>) decidedly support. Field remarks: “it may have been a <span class="ital">trivial</span> or <span class="ital">colloquial</span> word, such as would have stirred the bile of a Phrynichus or a Thomas Magister, who would have inserted it in their <span class="ital">Index Expurgatorius</span>, with a caution: <span class="greekheb">ἐπιβαλὼν μὴ λέγε ἀλλὰ ἐγκαλυψάμενος ἢ ἐπικαλυψάμενος</span>”. Brandt (<span class="ital">Die Ev. Gesch.</span>, p. 31), adopting a suggestion by Holwerda, thinks the original word may have been <span class="greekheb">ἐκβαλὼν</span> = going out, or flinging himself out. Klostermann ingeniously suggests: “stopped suddenly in his course of denial, like a man, running headlong, knocking suddenly against an obstacle in his way”. The choice seems to lie between the renderings: “thinking thereon” and “covering his head”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[141] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[142] Codex Regius--eighth century, represents an ancient text, and is often in agreement with א and B.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[143] Authorised Version.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[144] Revised Version.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/mark/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">72</span>. <span class="ital">And Peter called to mind</span>] That glance of sorrow went straight to the Apostle’s heart; all that his Lord had said, all His repeated warnings rushed back to his remembrance, and lit up the darkness of his soul.

Others render it (i) <span class="ital">abundantly</span> = “he wept <span class="ital">abundantly</span>,” as in the margin; others (ii) “<span class="ital">he began to weep;</span>” others (iii) “<span class="ital">he threw his mantle over his head;</span>” others (iv) “<span class="ital">he flung himself forth and wept</span>,”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he wept</span>] Not with the remorse of Judas, but the godly sorrow of true repentance. Observe that the Apostle has not lessened his fault, for it is from him, doubtless, through St Mark, we are informed “that the first crowing of the cock did not suffice to recal him to his duty, but a second was needed.” Lange.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/14.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-72.htm" title="And the second time the cock crew.
