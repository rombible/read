The precepts, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-8.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying,">Leviticus 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-10.htm" title="And he that is the high priest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;">Leviticus 21:10</a>; forbidding the high-priest to rend his clothes, relate only to the pontifical garments and to private mourning: that is, mourning on account of the calamities befalling himself or friends. Griefs of this kind the chief minister of religion was not to make public by any outward sign whatever. But it was neither unlawful nor unusual for him to rend his ordinary garments on account of public calamities, or instances of gross wickedness, as a testimony of his grief for the one and abhorrence of the other. See <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/11-71.htm" title="Then Jonathan rent his clothes, and cast earth upon his head, and prayed.">1Ma 11:71</a>. That the high-priest was clothed in his ordinary apparel on this occasion, appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/29-29.htm" title="And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them....">Exodus 29:29-30</a>, where the pontifical garments are ordered to descend from father to son; and therefore were to be worn only at their consecration, and when they ministered. <span class="ital">And saith, What need we any further witnesses </span>— Namely, of his being guilty of blasphemy. <span class="ital">Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? </span>— What punishment do you judge him to have deserved? <span class="ital">They all condemned him, to be guilty of death </span>— Namely, all present; for it is probable Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea, and some more, who were his disciples, or favourably disposed toward him, were not present: or if they were, they doubtless remonstrated against the iniquity of this sentence. <span class="ital">And some began to spit on him </span>— See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/26-67.htm" title="Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,...">Matthew 26:67-68</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:53-65 We have here Christ's condemnation before the great council of the Jews. Peter followed; but the high priest's fire-side was no proper place, nor his servants proper company, for Peter: it was an entrance into temptation. Great diligence was used to procure false witnesses against Jesus, yet their testimony was not equal to the charge of a capital crime, by the utmost stretch of their law. He was asked, Art thou the Son of the Blessed? that is, the Son of God. For the proof of his being the Son of God, he refers to his second coming. In these outrages we have proofs of man's enmity to God, and of God's free and unspeakable love to man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this fully explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-57.htm">Matthew 26:57-75</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>63.

The Accused had spoken. He had criminated Himself. All was uproar and confusion. The high-priest rent his linen robes. This was not lawful for him to do in cases of mourning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm" title="And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest you die, and lest wrath come on all the people: but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, mourn the burning which the LORD has kindled.">Leviticus 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-10.htm" title="And he that is the high priest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;">Leviticus 21:10</a>), but was allowable in cases of blasphemy (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-37.htm" title="Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.">2 Kings 18:37</a>). It was to be performed standing, and so that the rent was to be from the neck straight downwards. The use of the plural “his clothes,” by St Mark, seems to intimate that he tore all his clothes, except that which was next his body.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 63.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the high priest rent his</span> <span class="cmt_word">clothes</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">his tunics.</span>; St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-65.htm">Matthew 26:65</a>) has <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f70;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> literally, <span class="accented">his garments.</span> None but people of rank wore two tunics. The Greek verb here rendered "rent" implies violent dramatic action. The Jewish tunic was open under the chin, and large enough to receive the head, so that it could easily be placed over the shoulders, by inserting the head. When the wearer wished to give this sign of indignation or grief, he would seize the garment at this opening with both hands, and violently tear it asunder down to the waist. But it was unlawful for the high priest to do this in a private grief (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>). Some of the Fathers think that by this action Caiaphas involuntarily typified the rending of the priesthood from himself and from the Jewish nation. </body></html>
