Peter wounded one of the band. It is easier to fight for Christ than to die for him. But there is a great difference between faulty disciples and hypocrites. The latter rashly and without thought call Christ Master, and express great affection for him, yet betray him to his enemies. Thus they hasten their own destruction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Master, Master - As if expressing great joy that he had found him again.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 14:43-52.
