Those that are shy of godliness, are far in the way to deny Christ. Those who think it dangerous to be in company with Christ's disciples, because thence they may be drawn in to suffer for him, will find it much more dangerous to be in company with his enemies, because there they may be drawn in to sin against him. When Christ was admired and flocked after, Peter readily owned him; but will own no relation to him now he is deserted and despised. Yet observe, Peter's repentance was very speedy. Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall; and let him that has fallen think of these things, and of his own offences, and return to the Lord with weeping and supplication, seeking forgiveness, and to be raised up by the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this fully explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-57.htm">Matthew 26:57-75</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>68.

Weiss and Holtzmann think they were inserted by copyists under the impression that the words of Jesus to Peter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-30.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, you shall deny me thrice.">Mark 14:30</a>, meant that the cock was to crow twice in close succession, whereas the <span class="greekheb">δὶς</span> referred to the second time of cock-crowing, the beginning of the second watch after midnight. Schanz, while regarding this explanation of <span class="greekheb">δὶς</span> as unnatural, admits that it is difficult to understand how this first crow did not remind Peter of the Lord’s warning word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[137] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[138] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[139] Codex Regius--eighth century, represents an ancient text, and is often in agreement with א and B.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/mark/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">68</span>. <span class="ital">but he denied</span>] Thrown off his guard and perhaps disconcerted by the searching glances of the bystanders, Peter replied at first evasively, that he neither knew nor understood what she meant.

Here the second denial took place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/26-71.htm" title="And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said to them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth....">Matthew 26:71-72</a>), and for the first time <span class="ital">a cock crew</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 68.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he denied, saying, I neither know, nor understand</span> <span class="cmt_word">what thou sayest.</span> "This shows the great terror of Peter," says St. Chrysostom, "who, intimidated by the question of a poor servant-girl, denied his Lord; and who yet afterwards, when he had received the Holy Spirit, could say, 'We ought to obey God rather than man.'" <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">neither know</span>, <span class="accented">nor understand what thou sayest.</span> Every word here is emphatic. It amounts to this: "So little do I know who this Jesus is, that I know not what you say or what you ask concerning him. I know not who or what he is or anything about him. A question has been raised as to the number of times that Peter denied our Lord. The narratives are best explained by the consideration that all the denials took place in the house of Caiaphas. Furthermore, the accounts of the evangelists may be reconciled thus: First, Peter denied the Lord in the court of the high priest, when he was first asked by the maidservant, as he sat over the fire (Matthew 24:69); secondly, he denied him with an oath; thirdly, when urged still more, he denied him with many oaths and execrations. The cock crew the first time after the first denial, when we read (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-71.htm">Matthew 26:71</a>) that he went out into the porch (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). This crowing would be about one or two in the morning. The second crowing would not be until five or six. This shows us the length of time that the proceedings lasted. It was doubtless as Jesus through the court that he gave Peter that look of unutterable pain and grief which moved him at once to repentance. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/14.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Porch (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Only here in New Testament.
