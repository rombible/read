These miracles of our Lord assure us that he was not conquered, but a Conqueror. Now the disciples are convinced that Jesus is the Christ; they may bear to hear of his sufferings, of which Christ here begins to give them notice. He sees that amiss in what we say and do, of which we ourselves are not aware, and knows what manner of spirit we are of, when we ourselves do not. The wisdom of man is folly, when it pretends to limit the Divine counsels.

The Vulgate Latin reads, "as one of the prophets"; and so Beza's ancient copy as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-15.htm">Mark 6:15</a>. All spake highly and honourably of him: the people in common did not look upon him as a mean person; they perceived by his doctrine and more especially by his miracles that he was an extraordinary one: the several persons which they differently took him to be and make mention of were such as were of great repute; as John the Baptist, who had lately, been among them and whom all held to be a prophet, and indeed was more than a prophet; and Elias who was so very zealous for the Lord of hosts and wrought many miracles in his day; and whose coming the Jews were in expectation of to usher in the Messiah; and none thought him less than one of the prophets; and all agreed he was an uncommon man; even one raised from the dead as he must be, if he was John the Baptist or Elias or one of the old prophets; but they knew him not at least did not confess him to be the Messiah; he not appearing as a temporal prince, they were taught to believe he would be; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-14.htm">Matthew 16:14</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/8.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-28.htm" title="And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.">Mark 8:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">οἱ δὲ εἰπαν α</span>. <span class="greekheb">λέγοντες</span>, they said, saying; tautology, somewhat like the vulgar English idiom: He said, says he; fixing attention on what is said.—<span class="greekheb">Ἰωάννην τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Β</span>.: the accusative depending on <span class="greekheb">λέγουσιν οἱ ἄνθρωποί σε εἰναι</span> understood.

(1) Some, like the guilty Herod, said He was John the Baptist risen from the dead; (2) others that He was Elijah, who, like Enoch, had never died, but was taken up bodily to heaven and had now returned as Malachi predicted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-5.htm" title="And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:">Mark 4:5</a>); (3) others that He was Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-14.htm" title="And they said, Some say that you are John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.">Matthew 16:14</a>), who was expected to inaugurate the reign of the Messiah; (4) others again that He was one of the “old prophets” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-19.htm" title="They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.">Luke 9:19</a>). But they did not add that any regarded Him as the Messiah.</body></html>
