These miracles of our Lord assure us that he was not conquered, but a Conqueror. Now the disciples are convinced that Jesus is the Christ; they may bear to hear of his sufferings, of which Christ here begins to give them notice. He sees that amiss in what we say and do, of which we ourselves are not aware, and knows what manner of spirit we are of, when we ourselves do not. The wisdom of man is folly, when it pretends to limit the Divine counsels.

The Apostle who had restrained the Evangelist from preserving the record of that which redounded to his highest honour, suppresses the record neither of his own mistaken zeal, nor of the terrible rebuke it called forth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Get thee behind me</span>] The very words which He had used to the Tempter in the wilderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-10.htm" title="Then said Jesus to him, Get you hence, Satan: for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.">Matthew 4:10</a>), for in truth the Apostle was adopting the very argument which the great Enemy had adopted there.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thou savourest not</span>] Thou art <span class="bld">thinking of</span>, thy <span class="bld">thoughts centre on.</span> This rendering of the Greek word for “<span class="ital">to think</span>” is suggested by the Latin <span class="ital">sapere</span>, which is found in the Vulgate and retained from Wyclif’s Version. It is derived directly from the substantive <span class="ital">savour</span>, Fr. <span class="ital">saveur</span>, Lat. <span class="ital">sapor</span>, from <span class="ital">sapere</span>. Thus Latimer quoting <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-11.htm" title="When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.">1 Corinthians 13:11</a> writes, “When I was a child I <span class="ital">savoured</span> as a child.” “In confusion of them that so <span class="ital">saveren</span> earthely thinges.” Chaucer, <span class="ital">Parson’s Tale</span>. “Thy words shew,” our Lord would say to the Apostle, “that in these things thou enterest not into the thoughts and plans of God, but considerest all things only from the ideas of men. This attempt of thine to dissuade Me from My ‘baptism of death’ is a sin against the purposes of God.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div>[33. <span class="greekheb">Τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">His disciples</span>) who might have been very quickly carried away by Peter’s objection, so as to embrace views merely human.—V. g.]<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he turning about, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter.</span> The words indicate a sudden movement (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>), accompanied by a keen searching look at his disciples. Then he singles out Peter, and addresses to him, in their presence, the severe rebuke, <span class="cmt_word">Get thee behind me, Satan:</span> <span class="cmt_word">for thou savourest not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) - literally, <span class="accented">thou mindest not</span> -<span class="cmt_word">the things of God, but the</span>  <span class="cmt_word">things of men</span>. The form of words is the same as that used by our Lord to Satan himself, when he was tempted by him in the wilderness. It reminded him of that great conflict. The visions of worldly glory again floated before him. The crown without the cross was again held out to him. This explains his language. Peter was indeed rebuked; but the rebuke was aimed through him at the arch adversary who was addressing him through Peter. Here is the striking significance of his "turning about." Peter was for the moment doing the tempter's work, and in "turning about" our Lord was again putting Satan behind him. </body></html>
