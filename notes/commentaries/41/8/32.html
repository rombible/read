These miracles of our Lord assure us that he was not conquered, but a Conqueror. Now the disciples are convinced that Jesus is the Christ; they may bear to hear of his sufferings, of which Christ here begins to give them notice. He sees that amiss in what we say and do, of which we ourselves are not aware, and knows what manner of spirit we are of, when we ourselves do not. The wisdom of man is folly, when it pretends to limit the Divine counsels.

Peter's Noble Confession of Christ&#8212;Our Lord's First Explicit Announcement of His Approaching Sufferings, Death, and Resurrection&#8212;His Rebuke of Peter, and Warning to All the Twelve. ( = Mt 16:13-27; Lu 9:18-26).<p>For the exposition, see on [1461]Mt 16:13-28.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/mark/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 32,33. It is from hence manifest, that notwithstanding the confession of Peter, that he was the Christ, yet they had a very imperfect knowledge of the business of the redemption of man by the blood of Christ, and a very imperfect faith as to the hypostatical union of the Divine and human nature in the one person of the Redeemer; for had Peter known these things he would have seen a necessity of Christ’s dying and resurrection from the dead, in order to the redemption and salvation of man, and would neither have dissuaded our Saviour from it, nor doubted of the truth of what was spoken by him, who was the Truth, and could not lie. Our Saviour’s telling him ou froneiv, <span class="ital">thou savourest not, </span> might have been more favourably translated, thou understandest not, or thou mindest not, and must not be understood of a total ignorance, or regardlessness, or not relishing, but of a partial knowledge, the want of a due regard to or saviour of the things of God. Thou preferrest thy carnal affection to me, and indulgest thine own desires, to the hinderance of the honour and glory of God, and the salvation of souls, which I came to purchase by these my sufferings, and so art a Satan; an adversary, to me, who came to fulfil the will of my Father, and must not therefore give the least ear to thee, who, in what thou sayest, dost but seek and take care to please thyself. This leadeth him to the following discourse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he spake that saying openly,.... Concerning his sufferings, death, and resurrection from the dead. He not only spoke it before them all, but in plain words, without a figure; so that it might be, and was clearly understood by them; and he spake it as the word will also bear, not only very freely, but likewise boldly, with an undaunted courage, with intrepidity of mind; being not in the least discouraged, nor showing any concern or fear about what was to befall him: <p>and Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. Peter might more especially be concerned at this free and open account Christ gave of his sufferings and death, because he had just now acquainted him, that he should have the keys of the kingdom of heaven; by which he might understand some high post in the temporal kingdom of the Messiah he expected; and immediately to hear of his sufferings and death, damped his spirits, and destroyed his hopes, and threw him into such difficulties he was not able to remove; and therefore he takes Christ aside, and very warmly expostulates with him about what he had said, and chides him for it, and entreats him that he would not think, or talk of such like things: the words of Peter are recorded by Matthew; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-22.htm">Matthew 16:22</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> And he spake that saying openly.

And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.">Mark 8:32</a>. <span class="greekheb">παρρησίᾳ</span>: He spoke the word <span class="ital">plainly</span>, unmistakably. This remark was rendered almost necessary by the choice of the word <span class="greekheb">διδάσκειν</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-31.htm" title="And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.">Mark 8:31</a>. Mt.’s <span class="greekheb">δεικνύειν</span> implies <span class="greekheb">παρρησίᾳ</span>. This word (from <span class="greekheb">πᾶς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ῥῆσις</span>) in ordinary Greek usage means frank, unreserved speech, as opposed to partial or total silence. Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-14.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them plainly, Lazarus is dead.">John 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-25.htm" title="These things have I spoken to you in proverbs: but the time comes, when I shall no more speak to you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of the Father.">John 16:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-29.htm" title="His disciples said to him, See, now speak you plainly, and speak no proverb.">John 16:29</a>, it means plain speech as opposed to hints or veiled allusions, such as Jesus had previously given; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-20.htm" title="But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.">Mark 2:20</a> (bridegroom taken away). In this sense St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-12.htm" title="Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:">2 Corinthians 3:12</a>) claims <span class="greekheb">παρρησία</span> for the Christian ministry in contrast to the mystery connected with the legal dispensation as symbolised by the veil of Moses. The term was adopted into the Rabbinical vocabulary, and used to signify unveiled speech as opposed to metaphorical or parabolic speech (Wünsche, <span class="ital">Beiträge, ad loc.</span>).—<span class="greekheb">προσλαβόμενος ὁ Π</span>.: what Peter said is not given, Mk’s aim being simply to show that Jesus had so spoken that misunderstanding of what He said was impossible.

So say St. Chrysostom and others. Peter would not have his own confession of Christ thus evacuated, as it were; nor does he think it possible that the Son of God could be slain. So he takes him apart, lest he should seem to reprove him in the presence of the other disciples; and then he says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-22.htm">Matthew 16:22</a>), "Mercy on thee, Lord (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;</span>): this shall never be unto thee." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He spake the saying openly<p>Mark only.
