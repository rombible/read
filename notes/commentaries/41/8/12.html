Christ refused to answer their demand. If they will not be convinced, they shall not. Alas! what cause we have to lament for those around us, who destroy themselves and others by their perverse and obstinate unbelief, and enmity to the gospel! When we forget the works of God, and distrust him, we should chide ourselves severely, as Christ here reproves his disciples. How is it that we so often mistake his meaning, disregard his warnings, and distrust his providence?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sighed deeply in his spirit - His heart was deeply affected at their wickedness and hypocrisy.

He said a sign should be given, the same as was furnished by Jonas, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-4.htm">Matthew 16:4</a>.

And he sighed deeply in his spirit&#8212;The language is very strong. These glimpses into the interior of the Redeemer's heart, in which our Evangelist abounds, are more precious than rubies. The state of the Pharisaic heart, which prompted this desire for a fresh sign, went to His very soul.<p>and saith, Why doth this generation&#8212;"this wicked and adulterous generation" (Mt 16:4).<p>seek after a sign?&#8212;when they have had such abundant evidence already.<p>There shall no sign be given unto this generation&#8212;literally, "If there shall be given to this generation a sign"; a Jewish way of expressing a solemn and peremptory determination to the contrary (compare Heb 4:5; Ps 95:11, Margin). "A generation incapable of appreciating such demonstrations shall not be gratified with them." In Mt 16:4 He added, "but the sign of the prophet Jonas."

In his human soul; and which shows that he had one, and was subject to grief and sorrow, and all passions and infirmities, excepting sin. This deep sigh was on account of the hardness of their hearts, the malignity of their minds, and insincerity of their intentions; who had no view to come at truth by this inquiry, but to ensnare him: <p>and saith, why doth this generation seek after a sign? when so many have been shown among them, and they will not believe: <p>verily I say unto you, there shall no sign be given to this generation: such as they desired; namely, one from heaven.

This is a Hebrew idiom, based upon a form of taking an oath which prevailed amongst the Jews. The full form would be, "God do so and so to me, if so and so."
