This change makes the clause almost of necessity to be a part of our Lord's own words going before. It was not until the third day that our Lord interposed with a miracle, when the people were absolutely without food, and would therefore feel more sensibly the blessing as well as the greatness of the miracle. Their extremity was his opportunity. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Faint<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-32.htm">Matthew 15:32</a>.
