All are concerned to know this, if they expect him to heal their souls. They must not indulge the ease of the body. As the happiness of heaven with Christ, is enough to make up for the loss of life itself for him, so the gain of all the world in sin, will not make up for the ruin of the soul by sin. And there is a day coming, when the cause of Christ will appear as glorious, as some now think it mean and contemptible. May we think of that season, and view every earthly object as we shall do at that great day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He spake that saying openly - With boldness or confidence, or without parables or figures, so that there could be no possibility of misunderstanding him.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 8:27-38.

Luke saith, if he lose himself and be cast away. Though quchn was rightly translated <span class="ital">life</span> in the former verse, the sense justifying that translation of it there, yet here it is as truly translated <span class="ital">soul; </span> for there are many things which men value in proportion with their lives, their honour, estates, nay, many value their lusts above their lives; and Christ himself here teacheth us that his disciples ought to value his honour and glory, and their steady profession of faith and holiness, above their life, because he that will lose his life shall save it.

In the long run, in the issue of things, who by denying Christ, and his Gospel, may not only save his life for the present, but procure for himself great riches and wealth: <p>if he shall gain the whole world; were that possible to be done, and which the ambitious, worldly man is desirous of; yet supposing he: had his desire, of what avail would this be in the upshot of things, should the following be his case, as it will, <p>and lose his own soul? which is immortal and everlasting, when the world, and the glory of it pass away, and so is of more worth than the whole world. The world can only be enjoyed for a season, and that with a great deal of fatigue and trouble; but the soul continues for ever; and if it is lost and damned, its torment always abides, and the smoke of it ascends for ever, its worm never dies, and its fire is never quenched; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{11}</span> For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</span><p>(11) They are the most foolish of all men who purchase the pleasures of this life with the loss of everlasting bliss.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What doth it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">forfeit his life</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>). The word <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> in the Greek, originally meaning simply "breath," as the sign of life, is of very comprehensive import, embracing not merely "the breath of life," but also the "soul," or immortal part of man, as distinguished from his mortal body, also the mind or understanding, as the organ of thought. "Life" seems here to be the best English synonym, as being, like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, the more comprehensive term. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Gain - lose<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>. </body></html>
