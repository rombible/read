Christ knows and considers our frames. The bounty of Christ is always ready; to show that, he repeated this miracle. His favours are renewed, as our wants and necessities are. And those need not fear want, who have Christ to live upon by faith, and do so with thanksgiving.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I have compassions - I pity their condition.

I have compassion on the multitude&#8212;an expression of that deep emotion in the Redeemer's heart which always preceded some remarkable interposition for relief.

Christ is a compassionate Saviour both of the bodies and souls of men: he had compassion on the souls of this multitude, and therefore had been teaching them sound doctrine and he had compassion on the bodies of many of them, and had healed them of their diseases; and his bowels yearned towards them all; <p>because, says he, <p>they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat; for if they brought any food with them, it was all spent, and they were in a wilderness, where nothing was to be got; where they had no house to go into, nor bed to lie upon, and no provisions to be bought; and in this case they had been two nights and three days; which showed great affection and zeal in these people, and a close attachment to Christ, in exposing themselves to all these difficulties and hardships, which they seemed to bear with much patience and unconcernedness. The Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions prefix the word "behold" to this clause, as expressing admiration at their stay with him so long in such a place. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/8.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-2.htm" title="I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:">Mark 8:2</a>. <span class="ital">Vide</span> on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-32.htm" title="Then Jesus called his disciples to him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.">Matthew 15:32</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-2.htm" title="I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:">Mark 8:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἡμέραι</span>, <span class="ital">days</span>) The nominative of time, <span class="ital">there is</span>, or <span class="ital">there are</span>, being understood, forms an absolute mode of expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-28.htm" title="And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.">Luke 9:28</a>.<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I have compassion (&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>A peculiar verb, from &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, the inward parts, especially the nobler entrails - the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys.
