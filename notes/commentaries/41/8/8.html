In the record of the other similar miracle, the number of baskets corresponded to the number of the disciples. Here, as in the former miracle, far more food remained after all were fed than the original supply on which our Lord exercised his miraculous power; for each basket would contain much more than one loaf. The Greek word here rendered "basket" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) is a different word from that used for "basket" in the record of the other miracle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-43.htm">Mark 6:43</a>).
