For this purpose, they came forth with the Sadducees, (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-1.htm" title="The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven.">Matthew 16:1</a>,) who, though the opposites and rivals of the Pharisees in all other matters, joined them in their design of oppressing Jesus, and, along with them, demanded of him <span class="ital">a sign from heaven, tempting, </span>that is, <span class="ital">trying him. </span>See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-1.htm" title="The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven.">Matthew 16:1</a>. Some think the Jews, “understanding the prophecy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>, literally, expected the Messiah would make his first public appearance in the clouds of heaven, and take unto himself glory and a temporal kingdom:” and that, therefore, “when the Pharisees desired Jesus to show them a sign from heaven, they certainly meant that he should demonstrate himself to be the Messiah, by coming in a visible and miraculous manner from heaven with great pomp, and by wresting the kingdom out of the hands of the Romans.” These hypocrites craftily feigned an inclination to believe, if he could but give them sufficient evidence of his divine mission. However, their true design was, that by his failing to give the proof which they required, he should expose himself to general blame. <span class="ital">And he sighed deeply in his spirit </span>— Feeling the bitterest grief on account of the incorrigibleness of their disposition. <span class="ital">And said, Why doth this generation seek after a sign </span>— When so many signs, so many incontrovertible proofs of my mission from God have been already given, and continue to be given daily? <span class="ital">Verily there shall no sign be given </span>— None such as they seek; <span class="ital">to this generation </span>— See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/16-3.htm" title="And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O you hypocrites, you can discern the face of the sky; but can you not discern the signs of the times?...">Matthew 16:3-4</a>. The original expression here, <span class="greekheb">ει δοθησεται σημειον</span>, <span class="ital">if a sign shall be given, </span>is an elliptical form of an oath, as is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-11.htm" title="So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)">Hebrews 3:11</a>. In ordinary cases, it may be supplied out of the ancient forms of swearing, thus: <span class="ital">God do so to me, and more also, if a sign shall be given. </span>But, in the mouth of God, such an oath must be supplied thus: <span class="ital">Let me not be true, if they shall enter into my rest; if a sign shall be given, </span>&c. Or, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-16.htm" title="Though these three men were in it, as I live, said the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.">Ezekiel 14:16</a>, <span class="greekheb">ζω εγω</span>, <span class="greekheb">ει υιοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">θυγατερες σωθησονται</span>, <span class="ital">I live </span>not, <span class="ital">if sons </span>or <span class="ital">daughters be delivered.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:1-10 Our Lord Jesus encouraged the meanest to come to him for life and grace.

Magdala and Dalmanutha were both on the western shore of the lake, and probably not far apart. From the former the surname "Magdalene" was probably taken, to denote the residence of Mary Magdalene. Dalmanutha may have been a village, but it cannot now be identified with certainty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/mark/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 10-13. Matthew saith, he <span class="ital">came into the coasts of Magdala; </span> it is probable they were two contiguous tracts of land. We often read of the Pharisees coming to our Saviour to ask a sign. Had they not signs? What were all the miracles he wrought but signs of his Divine power and mission? But they ask for a sign from heaven, such a sign as Moses, Joshua, and Elijah gave them, by this means making a trial of his Divine power. Our Saviour, who never wrought miracles to satisfy men’s curiosity, but only to confirm their faith, refuseth to show them any such sign as they desired, and leaves these coasts. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And straightway he entered into a ship, with his disciples,....

The Arabic version reads it, "Magdal"; and in two of Beza's copies it is read, "Madegada"; but the Syriac version reads, "Dalmanutha"; and the Persic, "Dalmanuth"; and the Ethiopic, "Dalmathy": it was a city in the coasts of Magdala, and is thought by Dr. Lightfoot to be the same with Tzalmon, or Salmon, a place often mentioned (f) in the Jewish writings. <p>(f) Misn.

Here as in case of first feeding there is a crossing of the lake immediately after (<span class="greekheb">εὐθὺς</span>, which has an obvious reason in first case).

R., iii. 264). Weiss (in Meyer) adopts this view. Holtzmann (H.

Nothing is known of Dalmanutha.
