The first part of the answer is given in Matthew alone (Mt 16:2, 3): "He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather; for the sky is red. And in the morning, It will be foul weather to-day: for the sky is red and lowering [sullen, gloomy]. Hypocrites! ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?" The same simplicity of purpose and careful observation of the symptoms of approaching events which they showed in common things would enable them to "discern the signs of the times"&#8212;or rather "seasons," to which the prophets pointed for the manifestation of the Messiah. The scepter had departed from Judah; Daniel's seventy weeks were expiring, &c.; and many other significant indications of the close of the old economy, and preparations for a freer and more comprehensive one, might have been discerned.

By such a “sign” was meant an outward and visible luminous appearance in the sky or some visible manifestation of the <span class="ital">Shechînah</span>, the credentials of a prophet. They asked in effect, “Give us bread from heaven, as Moses did, or signs in the sun and moon like Joshua, or call down thunder and hail like Samuel, or fire and rain like Elijah, or make the sun turn back on the dial like Isaiah, or let us hear the <span class="ital">Bath-Kôl</span>, the ‘daughter of the Voice,’ that we may believe Thee.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-11.htm" title="And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.">Mark 8:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἤρξαντο</span>, <span class="ital">they began</span>) after a temporary cessation.

They had already asked for a sign from heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-38.htm">Matthew 12:38</a>); but now this miracle gives them occasion to ask again. For when they saw how greatly it  was extolled by the multitudes who had benefited by it, it was easy for them to urge that it was an earthly sign, and might have been wrought by him who is called "the God of this world;" and so they insinuated that he had wrought this miracle as well as his other miracles by the power of Satan. Therefore they seek a sign from heaven, that he who dwells in heaven might thus bear witness that he came from God, and that his doctrine was Divine; the Pharisees probably meant that if he did this they would believe in him as the Messiah, and lead the people to the same faith. The Sadducees, who were practically atheists, thought that no sign could be given from heaven by God, seeing that in their opinion it was doubtful whether there was any God to give it. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Began<p>The beginnings of things seem to have a peculiar interest for Mark.
