The points peculiar to St. Mark are, (1) that our Lord “spake that saying openly”—the absence of any reticence in this announcement of apparent failure was what startled the disciples; and (2) the graphic touch that as He rebuked Peter, He turned and looked, not on that Apostle only, but on the whole company of the disciples.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/mark/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/8-31.htm" title="And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again....">Mark 8:31-33</a></span>. <span class="ital">And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer</span> — The disciples being now convinced that Jesus was the Messiah, the Son of God, and having made confession of him as such, they were prepared to receive this further and equally important discovery, which they could not have borne before, without being so offended as to forsake him; and which, perhaps, they could hardly have borne now, had they thoroughly understood, and fully believed, Christ’s words; for they certainly still expected that he would assume external pomp and power, and <span class="ital">restore the kingdom of Israel, </span>an expectation which they held fast, even till the day of his ascension into heaven. <span class="ital">And he spake that saying openly </span>— <span class="greekheb">Παρρησια</span>, <span class="ital">plainly, </span>namely to the apostles. Our Lord frequently after this repeated the prediction of his sufferings; for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-22.htm" title="And while they stayed in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:">Matthew 17:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-18.htm" title="Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,">Matthew 20:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-2.htm" title="You know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.">Matthew 26:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-15.htm" title="And he said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:">Luke 22:15</a>. But it is remarkable that on none of those occasions was the prophecy delivered to any but the twelve, and a few select women, one instance excepted, namely, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-25.htm" title="But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.">Luke 17:25</a>, when it was expressed in terms somewhat obscure. The multitude of the disciples were never let into the secret, because it might have made them desert Christ, as they had not, like the apostles, raised expectations of particular preferments in his kingdom, to bias their understandings, and hinder them from perceiving the meaning of the prediction. It is true, he foretold his resurrection from the dead more publicly; for oftener than once he appealed to it as the principal proof of his mission, even in the presence of the priests, as is evident from their mentioning it to Pilate, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-63.htm" title="Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.">Matthew 27:63</a>. It seems the priests had often been our Lord’s hearers. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/16-21.htm" title="From that time forth began Jesus to show to his disciples, how that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day....">Matthew 16:21-23</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:27-33 These things are written, that we may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. These miracles of our Lord assure us that he was not conquered, but a Conqueror. Now the disciples are convinced that Jesus is the Christ; they may bear to hear of his sufferings, of which Christ here begins to give them notice. He sees that amiss in what we say and do, of which we ourselves are not aware, and knows what manner of spirit we are of, when we ourselves do not. The wisdom of man is folly, when it pretends to limit the Divine counsels. Peter did not rightly understand the nature of Christ's kingdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage illustrated in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/16-13.htm">Matthew 16:13-28</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 8:27-38. Peter's Noble Confession of Christ&#8212;Our Lord's First Explicit Announcement of His Approaching Sufferings, Death, and Resurrection&#8212;His Rebuke of Peter, and Warning to All the Twelve. ( = Mt 16:13-27; Lu 9:18-26).<p>For the exposition, see on [1461]Mt 16:13-28.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/mark/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Our Lord is elsewhere said to have taught his disciples, according as they were able to bear, or to hear, what he spake unto them. He did not at the first teach them that he must suffer death: the doctrine of the cross of Christ was like new wine not fit to be put into old bottles; yet necessary to be taught them, lest when they saw it soon after they should have been offended, as indeed they were to some degree, notwithstanding the premonition they had of it. With the doctrine of his suffering, he joins also the doctrine of his resurrection the third day: so saith Matthew. Mark saith, <span class="ital">after</span> <span class="ital">three days, </span> meta, which seemeth to be a difference between the two evangelists, and also a difficulty, when it is certain that our Saviour did not lie three entire days in the grave. But either Mark reckons the time from his first being betrayed and apprehended, so it was after three days; and Matthew speaketh only of the time which he lay in the grave, that was but part of three days; or else it was the fault of our translators to translate meta, <span class="ital"> after, </span> because indeed it often so signifies, whereas it sometimes signifies <span class="ital">in, </span> which had better fitted this text, to make it agree with Matthew. This is Grotius’s and Beza’s observation, (see his notes on the text), and is abundantly justified by <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-64.htm" title="Command therefore that the sepulcher be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.">Matthew 27:64</a></span>, where his adversaries desired of Pilate that the sepulchre might be made fast ewv thv trithv hmeras <span class="ital">until the third day, </span> because he had said while he was alive, Meta treiv hmerav egeiromai, <span class="ital">After three days I</span> <span class="ital">will arise, </span> which if they had understood of after the third day fully spent, they would not have petitioned that the sepulchre should have been made fast only until the third day, but it is plain they understood it the third day he would rise. So <span class="ital">after three days</span> here is, after the third day is come, not after the third day is past, which neither agrees with Matthew nor yet with the truth. If any desire further to make out this notion, he may read the learned Beza’s larger notes on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he began to teach them,.... For as yet he had said nothing to them about his sufferings and death, at least in express terms; but now they being firmly established in the faith of him, as the Messiah, he thought it proper to inform them, <p>that the son of man must suffer many things; meaning himself, as that he should be betrayed, apprehended, and bound, should be smitten, spit upon, buffeted, and scourged; and which things must be done, and he suffer them, because it was so determined by God, and foretold in the Scriptures: <p>and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests and Scribes; which composed the grand sanhedrim of the nation, and are the builders that were prophesied of by whom he should be rejected, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, <p>and be killed; in a violent manner; his life be taken away by force, without law, or justice: <p>and after three days rise again: not after three days were ended, and on the fourth day, but after the third day was come; that is, "on the third day", as the Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions read; and even the Pharisees themselves thus understood Christ, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-63.htm">Matthew 27:63</a>, so the phrase, "after eight days", is used for the eighth day, being come, or that same day a week later; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-28.htm">Luke 9:28</a> compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-1.htm">Matthew 17:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and <i>of</i> the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</span><p>(8) All that Christ suffered for us he suffered not unwillingly, neither as being unaware, but foreknowing it and willingly.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/8.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/8-31.htm" title="And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again....">Mark 8:31-33</a>. <span class="ital">First announcement of the Passion</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/mark/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">31</span>. <span class="ital">And he began to teach them</span>] The question and the answer it called forth were alike preparatory to strange and mournful tidings, which He now began to reveal distinctly to the Apostles respecting Himself, for clear and full before His eyes was the whole history of His coming sufferings, the agents through whom they would be brought about, the form they would take, the place where He would undergo them, and their issue, a mysterious resurrection after three days.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-31.htm" title="And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.">Mark 8:31</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου</span>, <span class="ital">the Son of Man</span>) He calls Himself by an humble title: after the resurrection, He says, <span class="ital">Christ</span> ought to have suffered; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-26.htm" title="Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?">Luke 24:26</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀποδοκιμασθῆναι</span>, <span class="ital">to be rejected</span>) For they [the elders, etc.] denied that which Peter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-29.htm" title="And he said to them, But whom say you that I am?

There are two great principles of faith, namely, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Divinity and the humanity of Christ, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> his cross and passion, whereby he has redeemed the world. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And it was necessary that the disciples should be thus instructed in his amazing dignity as the Son of God, lest, when they saw him put to death, they might doubt as to his Godhead.
