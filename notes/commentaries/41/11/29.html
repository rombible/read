These elders did not deserve to be taught; for it was plain that they contended not for truth, but victory: nor did he need to tell them; for the works he did, told them plainly he had authority from God; since no man could do the miracles which he did, unless God were with him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-23.htm">Matthew 20:23-27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 11:27-33.

This reputation John it seems universally had, so as to have denied his baptism to have been from heaven, had been to have exposed themselves to the mockings, if not the rage, of the people, which they were loath to do. If they had said, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From heaven, </span> they had accused themselves for not believing him, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-48.htm" title="Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?">John 7:48</a></span>.

The question which our Lord put to them was one on which hung the solution of that proposed by the scribes.

Believe then John the Baptist, who bare witness of me that I was sent from God to do these things." </body></html>
