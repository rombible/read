We should rest in no religion that does not make us fruitful in good works. Christ taught them from hence to pray in faith. It may be applied to that mighty faith with which all true Christians are endued, and which does wonders in spiritual things. It justifies us, and so removes mountains of guilt, never to rise up in judgment against us. It purifies the heart, and so removes mountains of corruption, and makes them plain before the grace of God. One great errand to the throne of grace is to pray for the pardon of our sins; and care about this ought to be our daily concern.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All the people were astonished - He became popular among them.

Of Jerusalem, as he did the evening before, and for the same reasons: probably he went to Bethany, where he had lodged the last night, with Lazarus, Martha, and Mary; or to the Mount of Olives, where he sometimes spent the night in prayer: the Syriac version renders it, "they went out"; for Christ took his disciples with him, as is evident from the following verse. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when even was come, he went out of the city.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/11.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-19.htm" title="And when even was come, he went out of the city.">Mark 11:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὅταν</span> (<span class="greekheb">ὅτε</span>, T.R.) implies repetition of the action.

During these last days before his crucifixion, he remained in Jerusalem during the day, and went back to Bethany at night. St. Matthew says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-17.htm">Matthew 21:17</a>), speaking of one of these days, "And he left them, and went forth out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there." So true it was that "he came unto his own, and his own received him not." No one in that city, which he loved so well, offered to receive him. The end was drawing near. But the intercourse with Martha and Mary must have been soothing to him; and Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>When evening was come (&#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., whenever evening came on; not on the evening of the purging of the temple merely, but each day at evening.</body></html>
