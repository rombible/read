In that region the subjective faith becomes an objective reality. We are to believe, not that we shall one day have what we pray for in a future more or less distant, but that we actually receive it as we pray. In most, if not in all cases, in prayer for peace, pardon, illumination, the promise, though it sounds hyperbolical, is psychologically true.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:19-26 The disciples could not think why that fig-tree should so soon wither away; but all wither who reject Christ; it represented the state of the Jewish church. We should rest in no religion that does not make us fruitful in good works. Christ taught them from hence to pray in faith. It may be applied to that mighty faith with which all true Christians are endued, and which does wonders in spiritual things. It justifies us, and so removes mountains of guilt, never to rise up in judgment against us. It purifies the heart, and so removes mountains of corruption, and makes them plain before the grace of God. One great errand to the throne of grace is to pray for the pardon of our sins; and care about this ought to be our daily concern.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Have faith in God - Literally, "Have the faith of God." This may mean, have strong faith, or have confidence in God; a strong belief that he is able to accomplish things that appear most difficult with infinite ease, as the fig-tree was made to wither away by a word.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them&#8212;This verse only generalizes the assurance of Mr 11:23; which seems to show that it was designed for the special encouragement of evangelistic and missionary efforts, while this is a directory for prevailing prayer in general.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/mark/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 24-26. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-22.htm" title="And all things, whatever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive.">Matthew 21:22</a>"</span>. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-14.htm" title="For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:">Matthew 6:14</a>"</span>. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-15.htm" title="But if you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.">Matthew 6:15</a>"</span>. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-7.htm" title="Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you:">Matthew 7:7</a>"</span>, in which texts we before met with what we have in these verses, teaching us the necessity of faith and charity to those who would so pray as to find acceptance with God. This also lets us know the necessity of people’s full satisfaction, that what things they ask of God in prayer are according to the will of God, without which it is not possible they should pray with a full persuasion that they shall receive whatsoever they in prayer ask of God. And because it is impossible we should in this point be fully satisfied, without a Divine revelation, as to things not necessary to salvation, our faith or persuasion can rise no higher, than a full persuasion, that if things of this nature, when we ask them of God in prayer, be such as are for our good, and for God’s glory, we shall receive them. The cause was otherwise as to those to whom Christ had given a power to work miracles; what they asked of that nature they must know it was the will of God to effect by them, and they could not without sin doubt of it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore I say unto you,.... For encouragement in prayer more particularly, without which nothing should be attempted, and especially which is above the power of nature, and is of a miraculous kind: <p>whatsoever things ye desire when ye pray; that is, according to the revealed will of God, is for the confirmation of his Gospel, and for the glory of his name: <p>believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them; the petitions that are desired, and the things asked in them: that is, be as much assured of having them, as if you had already received them, and you shall have them; for the sense can never be, that they should believe they received them before they had them; this would be a contradiction in terms; and Beza's ancient copy, and one of Stephens's copies read it, "believe that ye shall receive", as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-22.htm">Matthew 21:22</a>, and so the Vulgate Latin version; with which agree the Arabic and Ethiopic versions, which render it, "believe that ye shall enjoy", or "obtain"; and the Syriac version, "believe that ye are about to receive"; and great faith it is so to believe; and this is the prayer of faith; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-14.htm">1 John 5:14</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> ye receive <i>them</i>, and ye shall have <i>them</i>.</span><p>(f) Literally, that you receive it, speaking in the present tense, to show the certainty of the thing, and that it will indeed be performed.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/11.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-24.htm" title="Therefore I say to you, What things soever you desire, when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you shall have them.">Mark 11:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐλάβετε</span>; this reading ([104] [105] [106] [107] [108]) Fritzsche pronounces absurd.
