This would encourage his disciples who were full of fear. Also, that he was not disquieted at the thoughts of his approaching sufferings. But all marked his humiliation; and these matters teach us not to mind high things, but to condescend to those of low estate. How ill it becomes Christians to take state, when Christ was so far from claiming it! They welcomed his person; Blessed is he that cometh, the He that should come, so often promised, so long expected; he comes in the name of the Lord. Let him have our best affections; he is a blessed Saviour, and brings blessings to us, and blessed be He that sent him.

What the Messiah has still further to do, follows on the morrow. This at the same time in opposition to Baur (<span class="ital">Markusevang.</span> p. 89), who sees in the narrative of Mark only the later work of sober reflection adjusting the course of events; and in opposition to Hilgenfeld, who accuses Mark of an essential impropriety.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">περιβλεψάμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πάντα</span> is a preparatory significant statement in view of the measure of cleansing purposed on the morrow.

(4) At this feast He was anointed by Mary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-3.htm" title="Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.">John 12:3</a>); and (5) during the night a council of the Jews was convened to consider the propriety of putting not Him only but Lazarus also to death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-10.htm" title="But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;">John 12:10</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they came</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">when they draw near.</span> The Evangelist, passing over for the present the peaceful scene at the festal meal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/14-3.htm" title="And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she broke the box, and poured it on his head....">Mark 14:3-11</a>), translates us at once to Palm Sunday, as to time; and, as to place, to the region between Bethany and the mount of Olives. Observe how he writes in the present tense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto Bethphage</span>] On the first day of the Holy Week the Saviour left Bethany and proceeded towards Bethphage = <span class="ital">the house of unripe figs</span>, a little hamlet on the road between Jericho and Jerusalem.

St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-1.htm">Matthew 21:1</a>) says, "When they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and came unto Bethphage." St. Mark mentions the three places together, because Bethphage and Bethany, being near together, were also both of them close to Jerusalem. The distance from Jericho to Jerusalem (about seventeen miles) would involve a journey of about seven hours. The country between Jerusalem and Jericho is hilly, rugged, and desolate. It is from the height overhanging Bethany that the finest view of Jerusalem is gained. It appears from St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1</a>) that our Lord on the preceding sabbath had supped, and probably passed the night, at Bethany; and that on  the following day (answering to our Palm Sunday) he had come still nearer to Jerusalem, namely, to Bethphage; and from thence he sent two of his disciples for the ass and the colt. So his way to Jerusalem was from Bethany by Bethphage, the Mount of Olives, and the Valley of Jehoshaphat. The Valley of Jehoshaphat, through which flows the brook Kedron, lies close to Jerusalem. Bethphage literally means "the house of green figs," as Bethany, lying a short distance west of it, means "the house of dates." The date palm growing in the neighbeurhood would furnish the branches with which the multitude strewed the way on the occasion of our Lord's triumphal entry. <span class="cmt_word">He sendeth two of his disciples</span>. Who were they? Bede thinks that they were Peter and Philip. Jansonius, with greater probability, thinks that they were Peter and John, because a little after this Christ sent these two to prepare for the Passover. But we know nothing certain on this point. </body></html>
