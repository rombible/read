By believing in Christ, receiving him as a Saviour and Redeemer, and submitting to him in all his ordinances, as King of saints: <p>the same is my brother, and my sister, and my mother: such are openly, and manifestly related to Christ in a spiritual sense; and are as dear to him, and more so, than such persons are who stand in such a relation to others, or did to him according to the flesh. And this shows not only the near relation, and strong affection which Christ has for his people, but that he is not ashamed of them; and it may be concluded, that he will resent, in the keenest manner, every injury that is done them; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-50.htm">Matthew 12:50</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-35.htm" title="For whoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.">Mark 3:35</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὃς ἂν</span>, etc.: whosoever shall do the will of God (“of my Father in heaven,” Mt.), definition of true discipleship.—<span class="greekheb">ἀδελφός</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφή</span>, <span class="greekheb">μήτηρ</span>: without the article, because the nouns are used figuratively (Fritzsche).
