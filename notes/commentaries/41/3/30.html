It is as though he would explain to his readers what it was that had called forth so awful a warning. He does not absolutely identify what had been said with the sin against the Holy Ghost, but it tended to that sin, and therefore made the warning necessary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/mark/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-30.htm" title="Because they said, He has an unclean spirit.">Mark 3:30</a></span>. <span class="ital">Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit </span>— That is, because they said, <span class="ital">he hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth out devils, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-22.htm" title="And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casts he out devils.">Mark 3:22</a>. Is it not astonishing that men who have ever read these words should doubt what is the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost? Can any words declare more plainly that it is “the ascribing those miracles to the power of the devil, which Christ wrought by the power of the Holy Ghost?”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:22-30 It was plain that the doctrine of Christ had a direct tendency to break the devil's power; and it was as plain, that casting of him out of the bodies of people, confirmed that doctrine; therefore Satan could not support such a design. Christ gave an awful warning against speaking such dangerous words. It is true the gospel promises, because Christ has purchased, forgiveness for the greatest sins and sinners; but by this sin, they would oppose the gifts of the Holy Ghost after Christ's ascension. Such is the enmity of the heart, that unconverted men pretend believers are doing Satan's work, when sinners are brought to repentance and newness of life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the scribes ... - See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24-32</a>.

They charged Christ with having a devil, and his miracles with being wrought by the help of the devil; when, at the same time, they knew in their own consciences they were works which were wrought by the finger and Spirit of God, and so were guilty of the sin against the Holy Ghost; the unpardonable sin, for which there is no remission: and this is mentioned as a reason why our Lord said what he did concerning that sin; because they had been guilty of it, and so were liable to everlasting punishment on account of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{p}</span> Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.</span><p>(p) These are the words of the evangelist.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-30.htm" title="Because they said, He has an unclean spirit.">Mark 3:30</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἔλεγον</span>, etc., because they said: “He hath an unclean spirit,” therefore He said this about blasphemy against the Holy Ghost—such is the connection. But what if they spoke under a misunderstanding like the friends, puzzled what to think about this strange man? That would be a sin against the Son of Man, and as such pardonable. The distinction between blasphemy against the Son of Man and blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, taken in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-31.htm" title="Why I say to you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven to men.">Matthew 12:31</a>, is essential to the understanding of Christ’s thought. The mere saying, “He hath an unclean spirit,” does not amount to the unpardonable sin. It becomes such when it is said by men who know that it is not true; then it means calling the Holy Spirit an unclean spirit. Jesus believed that the scribes were in that position, or near it.<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>They said (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Imperfect tense.
