May the Lord send forth more and more of those who have been with him, and have learned of him to preach his gospel, to be instruments in his blessed work. Those whose hearts are enlarged in the work of God, can easily bear with what is inconvenient to themselves, and will rather lose a meal than an opportunity of doing good. Those who go on with zeal in the work of God, must expect hinderances, both from the hatred of enemies, and mistaken affections of friends, and need to guard against both.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They could not so much as eat bread - Their time and attention were so occupied that they were obliged to forego their regular meals. The affairs of religion may so occupy the attention of ministers and others as to prevent their engaging in their customary pursuits. Religion is all-important - far more important than the ordinary business of this life; and there is nothing unreasonable if our temporal affairs sometimes give way to the higher interests of our own souls and the souls of others. At the same time, it is true that religion is ordinarily consistent with a close attention to worldly business. It promotes industry, economy, order, neatness, and punctuality - all indispensable to worldly prosperity. Of these there has been no more illustrious example than that of our Saviour himself. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 3:20-30.

There is no small dispute who are here called our Saviour’s friends, oi par’ autou, those who were of him, whether it signifieth his neighbours, the citizens of his city, or his nearer relations, those who belonged to the family of which he was (for he had some brethren that did not <span class="ital">believe in him, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-5.htm" title="For neither did his brothers believe in him.">John 7:5</a></span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">They went to lay hands on him, </span> that is, to take him from the multitude, which pressed upon him by force, (for so the word signifies), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">for they said, He is beside himself, </span> exesth: various senses are given of this word, but certainly the most ordinary interpretation of it doth best agree to this place. They saw our Saviour’s warmth of spirit and zeal in the prosecution of that for which he came into the world, and did so well understand his person, or mission, and receiving the Spirit not by measure, that they took what he did to be the product and effect of a natural infirmity and imperfect head and disordered reason. The young prophet sent by Elisha was counted a <span class="ital">mad fellow</span> by Jehu’s comrades, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-11.htm" title="Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said to him, Is all well? why came this mad fellow to you?

We are naturally inclined to inquire the causes of strange and unusual effects, and cannot always discern the true causes, and often make false guesses at them. I am not so prone as I find some to condemn these friends, or neighbours, or kinsmen of Christ, believing that they did verily believe as they spake, not yet fully understanding that the Spirit of the Lord in that measure was upon him, but through their infirmity fearing that he had been under some distraction, and charitably offering their help to him. The next words tell us of a far worse sense the scribes put upon his actions. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the multitude coming together again,....

Nevertheless, the abrupt and unconnected mode of adding one account to another, as here by the <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἔρχονται εἰς οἶκον</span>, as well as the omission of longer discourses, are peculiar to Mark and in keeping with the originality of his work; further, it would be quite impossible to see why the discourse, if it had originally a place here, should have been entirely removed, whether we may conceive for ourselves its original contents and compass in the main according to Matthew or according to Luke. Ewald’s view has, however, been followed by Holtzmann, whom Weiss, in the <span class="ital">Jahrb. f.

The sermon on the mount followed upon the call of the apostles, at all events so far as it affected them and their mission. Moreover, St. Matthew interposes here two miracles wrought by our Lord after his descent from the mount, and before his return to his own house at Capernaum. St. Mark seems anxious here to hasten on to describe the treatment of our Lord by his own near relatives at this important crisis in his ministry. <span class="cmt_word">So that they</span> - <span class="accented">i.e</span>., our Lord and his disciples - <span class="cmt_word">could not so much as eat bread</span>; such was the pressure of the crowd upon them. St. Mark evidently records this, in order to show the contrast between the zeal of the multitude and the very different feelings of our Lord's own connections. They, his friends, when they heard how he was thronged, <span class="cmt_word">went out to lay hold on him; for they said, He is beside himself</span>. This little incident is mentioned only by St. Mark. When his friends saw him so bent upon his great mission as to neglect his bodily necessities, they considered that he was bereft of his reason, that too much zeal and piety had deranged his mind. His friends went out (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) to lay hold on him. They may probably have come from Nazareth. St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a>) says that "even his brethren did not believe on him;" that is, they did not believe in him with that fuiness of trust which is of the essence of true faith.
