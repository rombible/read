Those whose hearts are enlarged in the work of God, can easily bear with what is inconvenient to themselves, and will rather lose a meal than an opportunity of doing good.

He is probably a distinct person from James the Lord’s brother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-19.htm" title="But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.">Galatians 1:19</a>), and author of the Epistle, which bears his name.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>x. <span class="ital">Thaddæus</span>] i. e. <span class="ital">Judas</span>, a brother, or possibly a son of James, bishop of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-13.htm" title="And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where stayed both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.">Acts 1:13</a>). He was surnamed <span class="ital">Thaddæus</span> and <span class="ital">Lebbæus</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-3.htm" title="Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;">Matthew 10:3</a>), which some interpret as = “<span class="ital">cordatus</span> or <span class="ital">animosus</span>” = “a man of energy and courage.” He is the author of the Epistle which bears his name. Once only in the Gospels do we find any act or saying of his recorded, viz., in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-22.htm" title="Judas said to him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?">John 14:22</a>, “<span class="ital">Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?</span>”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>xi. <span class="ital">Simon</span>] <span class="ital">the Cananite, or Cananœan</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-4.htm" title="Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.">Matthew 10:4</a>), in Greek <span class="ital">Zelotes</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-15.htm" title="Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,">Luke 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-13.htm" title="And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where stayed both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.">Acts 1:13</a>). The spelling of the English Version here is misleading. The word does not signify a native of Canaan, or of Cana, but comes from a Chaldee or Syriac word <span class="ital">Kanean</span> or <span class="ital">Kaneniah</span>, by which the Jewish sect or faction of “the Zealots” was designated. To this sect Simon had probably belonged before his call.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Andrew</span> is next mentioned after these eminent apostles, as the first called. The word is from the Greek, and means "manly." <span class="cmt_word">Bartholomew</span>, that is, Bar-tolmai, the son of Tolmay. This is a patronymic, and not a proper name. It has been with good reason supposed that he is identical with Nathanael, of whom we first read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>, as having been found by Philip and brought to Christ. In the three synoptic Gospels we find Philip and Bartholomew enumerated together in the lists of the apostles; and certainly the mode in which Nathanael is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2</a> would seem to show that he was an apostle. His birthplace, too, Cana of Galilee, would point to the same conclusion. If this be so, then the name Nathanael, the "gift of God," would bear the same relation to Bartholomew that Simon does to Bar-jona. Matthew. In St Matthew's own list of the apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-3.htm">Matthew 10:3</a>) the epithet "the publican" is added to his name, and he places himself after Thomas. This marks the humility of the apostle, that he does not scruple to place on record what he was before he was called. The word Matthew, a contraction of Mattathias, means the "gift of Jehovah," according to Gesenius, which in Greek would be "Theodore." Thomas. Eusebius says that his real name was Judas. It is possible that Thomas may have been a surname. The word is Hebrew meaning a twin, and it is so rendered in Greek in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-16.htm">John 11:16</a><span class="cmt_word">. James the son of Alphaeus,</span> or Clopas (not Cleophas): called" the Less," either because he was junior in age, or rather in his call, to James the Great, the brother of John. This James, the son of Alphaeus, is called the brother of our Lord. St. Jerome says that his father Alphaeus, or Clopas, married Mary, a sister of the blessed Virgin Mary, which would make him the cousin of our Lord. This view is confirmed by Bishop Pearson (Art. 3:on the Creed). He was the writer of the Epistle which bears his name, and he became Bishop of Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Thaddaeus</span>, called also Lebbaeus and Judas; whence St. Jerome describes him as "trionimus," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> having three names. Judas would be his proper name. Lebbaeus and Thaddaeus have a kind of etymological affinity, the root of Lebbaeus being "heart," and of Thaddaeus, "breast." These names are probably recorded to distinguish him from Judas the traitor. <span class="cmt_word">Simon the Canaanite</span>. The word in the Greek, according to the best authorities, is, both here and in St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-4.htm">Matthew 10:4</a>), <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, from a Chaldean or Syriac word, <span class="accented">Kanean</span>, <span class="accented">or Kanenieh.</span> The Greek equivalent is <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, which we find preserved in St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-15.htm">Luke 6:15</a>). It is possible, however, that Simon may have been born in Cana of Galilee. St. Jerome says that he was called a Cananaean or Zealot, by a double reference to the place of his birth and to his zeal. <span class="cmt_word">Judas Iscariot</span>. <span class="accented">Iscariot.</span> The most probable derivation is from the Hebrew <span class="accented">lsh-Kerioth</span>, "a man of Kerioth,' a city of the tribe of Judah. St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-7.htm">John 6:7</a>) describes him as the son of Simon. If it be asked why our Lord should have chosen Judas Iscariot, the answer is that he chose him, although he knew that he would betray him, because it was his will that he should be betrayed by one that had been "his own familiar friend," and that had "eaten bread with him." Bengel says well here that "there is an election of grace from which men may fall." How far our Lord knew from the first the results of his choice of Judas belongs to the profound, unfathomable mystery of the union of the Godhead and the manhood in his sacred Person. We may notice generally, with regard to this choice by our Lord of his apostles, the germ of the principle of sending them forth by two and two. Here are Peter and Andrew, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, and so on. Then, again, our Lord chose three pairs of brothers, Peter and Andrew, James and John, James the Less and Jude, that he might teach us how powerful an influence is brotherly love. We may also observe that Christ, in selecting his apostles, chose some of his kinsmen according to the flesh. When he took upon him our flesh, he recognized those who were near to him by nature, and he would unite them yet mere closely by grace to his Divine nature. Three of the apostles took the lead, namely, Peter and James and John, who were admitted to be witnesses of his transfiguration, of one of his greatest miracles, and of his passion. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Andrew (&#x391;&#768;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>A name of Greek origin though in use among the Jews, from &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;, man, and signifying manly.

In ecclesiastical legend he is said to have been a chariot-driver.<p>Bartholomew<p>A Hebrew name - Bar Tolmai, son of Tolmai. Almost certainly identical with Nathanael. Philip and Nathanael are associated by John, as are Philip and Bartholomew in the parallel passages of the synoptics. Bartholomew is not mentioned in John's list of the twelve (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2</a>), but Nathanael is; while the synoptists do not mention Nathanael in their lists, but do mention Bartholomew.

See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-4.htm">Matthew 10:4</a> : "No name is more striking in the list than that of Simon the Zealot, for to none of the twelve could the contrast be so vivid between their former and their new position. What revolution of thought and heart could be greater than that which had thus changed into a follower of Jesus one of the fierce war-party of the day, which looked on the presence of Rome in the Holy Land as treason against the majesty of Jehovah, a party who were fanatical in their Jewish strictures and exclusiveness ?"
