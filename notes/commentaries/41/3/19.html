The other evangelists, indeed, inform us of some previous events which happened in the meantime, but they might be despatched in a few hours. <span class="ital">And the multitude cometh together </span>— Assembled again about the doors and windows of the house, and pressed so eagerly upon him; <span class="ital">that they </span>— Christ and his disciples, or the members of the family <span class="ital">— could not so much as eat bread</span> — Or take any sustenance, though it was the proper hour for it. <span class="ital">And when his friends heard of it </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">οι παρ</span>’ <span class="greekheb">αυτου</span>; “a common phrase,” says Dr. Campbell, “for denoting <span class="ital">sui, </span>(so the Vulgate,) <span class="ital">his friends, propinqui, cognati, his kinsmen </span>or <span class="ital">relations. </span>I prefer,” says he, “the word <span class="ital">kinsmen, </span>as the circumstances of the story evince that it is not his disciples who are meant.” This interpretation of the expression the doctor defends very ably by a critical examination of the original text, and an elaborate exposition of the verse; but which is too long to be inserted here. <span class="ital">They went </span>— Or, <span class="ital">went forth, </span>namely, from their own homes; to <span class="ital">lay hold on him</span> — Namely, says Grotius, “that they might take him away from that house, in which he was pressed, to another place:” <span class="ital">for they said, </span><span class="greekheb">Οτι εξεστη</span>, <span class="ital">that he faints, </span>or, <span class="ital">may faint; </span>so Grotius, Dr. Whitby, and some others, understand the word, thinking it “absurd to say, that Christ did, either in his gestures or in his actions, show any symptoms of transportation or excess of mind; nor could his kindred, they think, have any reason to conceive thus of him, who had never given the least symptoms of any such excess, though those of them who believed not in him, might have such unworthy thoughts of him.” Dr. Hammond, however, justly observes that the word here used “doth, in all places of the New Testament but this and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-13.htm" title="For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.">2 Corinthians 5:13</a>, signify being <span class="ital">amazed, </span>or <span class="ital">astonished, </span>or in some sudden perturbation of mind, depriving a person of the exercise of his faculties. And in the place just referred to, it is opposed to <span class="greekheb">σωφρονειν</span>, sobriety, or temper. And thus in the Old Testament it is variously used for excess, vehemency, or commotion of mind. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-22.htm" title="For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before your eyes: nevertheless you heard the voice of my supplications when I cried to you.">Psalm 31:22</a>, we read, <span class="ital">I said in my haste, </span>&c., where the Greek is, <span class="greekheb">εν τη εκστασει μου</span>, <span class="ital">in the excess, </span>or <span class="ital">vehemence of my mind. </span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Accordingly, here he supposes the word may be most fitly taken for a <span class="ital">commotions, excess, vehemence, </span>or transportation of mind, acting or speaking in zeal, (above what is ordinarily called <span class="ital">temper </span>and <span class="ital">sobriety;</span>) or in such a manner as they were wont to act or speak who were moved by some extraordinary influence, as the prophets, and other inspired persons, according to that of Chrysostom, <span class="greekheb">Τουτο μαντεως ιδιον το εξεστηκεναι</span>, <span class="ital">It belongs to prophets to be thus transported, </span>which sense of the word is suited to the place, for in this chapter Christ begins to show himself in the full lustre of his office; he cures on the sabbath day, which the Pharisees conceived to be unlawful; looks about him <span class="ital">with anger, </span>or some incitation of mind; is followed by great multitudes; heals the diseased, and is flocked to for that purpose; is called openly <span class="ital">the Son of God </span>by the demoniacs; makes twelve disciples, and commissions them to preach and to do cures. Upon this the Pharisees and Herodians take counsel against him, and those of their faction say, <span class="ital">He acts by Beelzebub, </span>and is possessed by him, that is, that he was actuated by some principal evil spirit, and did all his miracles thereby; and so was not to be followed, but abhorred by men. And they who uttered not these high blasphemies against him, yet thought and said, <span class="greekheb">οτι εξεστη</span>, <span class="ital">that he was in an excess, </span>or transportation of mind, and this, it seems, was the conceit of his own kindred. They had a special prejudice against him, chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-4.htm" title="But Jesus, said to them, A prophet is not without honor, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.">Mark 6:4</a>; and <span class="ital">did not believe on him, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-5.htm" title="For neither did his brothers believe in him.">John 7:5</a>; and accordingly, hearing a report of his doing these extraordinary things, they came out, <span class="greekheb">κρατησαι</span>, to lay hold on, or get him into their hands, and take him home with them, for they said he was guilty of some excesses.” The above interpretation supposes the sense of the expression to be nearly the same with that which is given by our translators, <span class="ital">He is beside himself, </span>which has the sanction of the Vulgate, <span class="ital">in furorem versus est, </span>and which, as has been noticed, is fully justified by Dr. Campbell, who concludes his defence of it in the following words: “I cannot help observing, on the whole, that in the way the verse is here rendered, no signification is assigned to the words which it is not universally allowed they frequently bear; no force is put upon the construction, but every thing interpreted in the manner which would most readily occur to a reader of common understanding, who, without any preconceived opinion, entered on the study. On the contrary, there is none of the other interpretations which does not, as has been shown, offer some violence to the words or to the syntax; in consequence of which, the sense extracted is far from being that which would most readily present itself to an unprejudiced reader. It hardly admits a doubt, that the only thing which has hindered the universal concurrence of translators in the common version, is the unfavourable light it puts our Lord’s relations in. But that their disposition was, at least, not always favourable to his claims, we have the best authority for asserting.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:13-21 Christ calls whom he will; for his grace is his own. He had called the apostles to separate themselves from the crowd, and they came unto him. He now gave them power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils. May the Lord send forth more and more of those who have been with him, and have learned of him to preach his gospel, to be instruments in his blessed work. Those whose hearts are enlarged in the work of God, can easily bear with what is inconvenient to themselves, and will rather lose a meal than an opportunity of doing good. Those who go on with zeal in the work of God, must expect hinderances, both from the hatred of enemies, and mistaken affections of friends, and need to guard against both.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Boanerges - This word is made up of two Hebrew words signifying "sons of thunder," meaning that they, on some accounts, "resembled" thunder.
