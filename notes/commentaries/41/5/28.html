The erroneous faith.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span> In general terms there is here an illustration of how intellectual error may coexist with sincere faith. The precise form of error is clearly that she looked on the physical contact with the material garment as the vehicle of healing-the very same thing which we find ever since running through the whole history of the Church, <span class="ital">e.g.</span> the exaltation of externals, rites, ordinances, sacraments, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Take two or three phases of it-<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> 1. You get it formularised into a system in sacramentarianism.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {a} Baptismal regeneration,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {b} Holy Communion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Religion becomes largely a thing of rites and ceremonies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> 2. You get it in Protestant form among Dissenters in the importance attached to Church membership.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Outward acts of worship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There is abroad a vague idea that somehow we get good from external association with religious acts, and so on. This feeling is deep in human nature, is not confined to the Roman Catholic Church, and is not the work of priests. There is a strange revival of it to-day, and so there is need of protest against it in every form.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The blessing that comes to an erroneous faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The woman here was too ‘ritualistic.’ How many good people there are in that same school to-day! Yet how blessed for us all, that, even along with many errors, if we grasp <span class="ital">Him</span> we shall not lose the grace.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Christ’s gentle enlightenment on the error.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘Thy faith hath saved thee.’ How wonderfully beautiful! He cures by giving the blessing and leading on to the full truth. In regard to the woman, it might have been that her touch <span class="ital">did</span> heal; but even there in the physical realm, since it was He, not His robe, that healed, it was her faith, not her hand, that procured the blessing. This is universally true in the spiritual realm.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {a} Salvation is purely spiritual and inward in its nature-not an outward work, but a new nature, ‘love, joy, peace.’ Hence {b} Faith is the condition of salvation. Faith saves because <span class="ital">He</span> saves, and faith is contact with Him. It is the only thing which joins a soul to Christ. Then learn what makes a Christian.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {c} Hence, the place of externals is purely subsidiary to faith. If they help a man to believe and feel more strongly, they are good. Their only office is the same as that of preaching or reading. In both, truth is the agent. Their power is in enforcing truth.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:21-34 A despised gospel will go where it will be better received. One of the rulers of a synagogue earnestly besought Christ for a little daughter, about twelve years old, who was dying. Another cure was wrought by the way. We should do good, not only when in the house, but when we walk by the way, De 6:7. It is common with people not to apply to Christ till they have tried in vain all other helpers, and find them, as certainly they will, physicians of no value. Some run to diversions and gay company; others plunge into business, or even into intemperance; others go about to establish their own righteousness, or torment themselves by vain superstitions. Many perish in these ways; but none will ever find rest to the soul by such devices; while those whom Christ heals of the disease of sin, find in themselves an entire change for the better. As secret acts of sin, so secret acts of faith, are known to the Lord Jesus. The woman told all the truth. It is the will of Christ that his people should be comforted, and he has power to command comfort to troubled spirits. The more simply we depend on Him, and expect great things from him, the more we shall find in ourselves that he is become our salvation. Those who, by faith, are healed of their spiritual diseases, have reason to go in peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Came in the press behind - In the crowd that pressed upon him.
