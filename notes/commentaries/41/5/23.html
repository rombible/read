One of the rulers of a synagogue earnestly besought Christ for a little daughter, about twelve years old, who was dying. Another cure was wrought by the way. We should do good, not only when in the house, but when we walk by the way, De 6:7. It is common with people not to apply to Christ till they have tried in vain all other helpers, and find them, as certainly they will, physicians of no value. Some run to diversions and gay company; others plunge into business, or even into intemperance; others go about to establish their own righteousness, or torment themselves by vain superstitions. Many perish in these ways; but none will ever find rest to the soul by such devices; while those whom Christ heals of the disease of sin, find in themselves an entire change for the better. As secret acts of sin, so secret acts of faith, are known to the Lord Jesus. The woman told all the truth. It is the will of Christ that his people should be comforted, and he has power to command comfort to troubled spirits. The more simply we depend on Him, and expect great things from him, the more we shall find in ourselves that he is become our salvation. Those who, by faith, are healed of their spiritual diseases, have reason to go in peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lieth at the point of death - Is dying; in the last agonies.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter&#8212;Luke (Lu 8:42) says, "He had one only daughter, about twelve years of age." According to a well-known rabbin, quoted by Lightfoot, a daughter, till she had completed her twelfth year, was called "little," or "a little maid"; after that, "a young woman."<p>lieth at the point of death&#8212;Matthew (Mt 9:18) gives it thus: "My daughter is even now dead"&#8212;"has just expired." The news of her death reached the father after the cure of the woman with the issue of blood: but Matthew's brief account gives only the result, as in the case of the centurion's servant (Mt 8:5, &c.).<p>come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live&#8212;or, "that she may be healed and live," according to a fully preferable reading. In one of the class to which this man belonged, so steeped in prejudice, such faith would imply more than in others.<p>The Woman with an Issue of Blood Healed (Mr 5:24-34).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/mark/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-21.htm" title="And when Jesus was passed over again by ship to the other side, much people gathered to him: and he was near to the sea.">Mark 5:21</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And besought him greatly,....

The multitude kept following and thronging as he went along. The preposition &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;, together, in the latter verb, indicates the united pressure of a crowd.
