Mark’s date appears to be later, but he may have anticipated the feast in his narrative, in order to keep the whole of the incidents relating to Matthew’s apostleship together. Jairus’s knowledge of Jesus is implied in the story, and perhaps Jesus’ acquaintance with him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. We note, first, the agonised appeal and the immediate answer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Desperation makes men bold. Conventionalities are burned up by the fire of agonised petitioning for help in extremity. Without apology or preliminary, Jairus bursts in, and his urgent need is sufficient excuse. Jesus never complains of scant respect when wrung hearts cry to Him. But this man was not only driven by despair, but drawn by trust. He was sure that, even though his little darling had been all but dead when he ran from his house, and was dead by this time, for all he knew, Jesus could give her life. Perhaps he had not faced the stern possibility that she might already be gone, nor defined precisely what he hoped for in that case. But he was sure of Jesus’ power, and he says nothing to show that he doubted His willingness. A beautiful trust shines through his words, based, no doubt, on what he had known and seen of Jesus’ miracles. <span class="ital">We</span> have more pressing and deeper needs, and we have fuller and deeper knowledge of Jesus, wherefore our approach to Him should be at least as earnest and confidential as Jairus’s was. If our Lord was at the feast when this interruption took place, His gracious, immediate answer becomes more lovely, as a sign of His willingness to bring the swiftest help. ‘While they are yet speaking, I will hear.’ Jairus had not finished asking before Jesus was on His feet to go.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The father’s impatience would be satisfied when they were on their way, but how he would chafe, and think every moment an age, while Jesus stayed, as if at entire leisure, to deal with another silent petitioner! But His help to one never interferes with His help to another, and no case is so pressing as that He cannot spare time to stay to bless some one else. The poor, sickly, shamefaced woman shall be healed, and the little girl shall not suffer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. We have next the extinction and rekindling of Jairus’s glimmer of hope. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Distances in Capernaum were short, and the messenger would soon find Jesus. There was little sympathy in the harsh, bald announcement of the death, or in the appended suggestion that the Rabbi need not be further troubled. The speaker evidently was thinking more of being polite to Jesus than of the poor father’s stricken heart, Jairus would feel then what most of us have felt in like circumstances,-that he had been more hopeful than he knew. Only when the last glimmer is quenched do we feel, by the blackness, how much light had lingered in our sky, But Jesus knew Jairus’s need before Jairus himself knew it, and His strong word of cheer relit the torch ere the poor father had time to speak. That loving eye reads our hearts and anticipates our dreary hopelessness by His sweet comfortings. Faith is the only victorious antagonist of fear. Jairus had every reason for abandoning hope, and his only reason for clinging to it was faith. So it is with us all. It is vain to bid us not be afraid when real dangers and miseries stare us in the face; but it is not vain to bid us ‘believe,’ and if we do that, faith, cast into the one scale, will outweigh a hundred good reasons for dread and despair cast into the other.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. We have next the tumult of grief and the word that calms. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The hired mourners had lost no time, and in Eastern fashion were disturbing the solemnity of death with their professional shrieks and wailings. True grief is silent. Woe that weeps aloud is soon consoled.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> What a contrast between the noise outside and the still death-chamber and its occupant, and what a contrast between the agitation of the sham comforters and the calmness of the true Helper! Christ’s great word was spoken for us all when our hearts are sore and our dear ones go. It dissolves the dim shape into nothing ness, or, rather, it transfigures it into a gracious, soothing form. Sleep is rest, and bears in itself the pledge of waking. So Christ has changed the ‘shadow feared of man’ into beauty, and in the strength of His great word we can meet the last enemy with ‘Welcome! friend.’ It is strange that any one reading this narrative should have been so blind to its deepest beauty as to suppose that Jesus was here saying that the child had only swooned, and was really alive. He was not denying that she was what men call ‘dead,’ but He was, in the triumphant consciousness of His own power, and in the clear vision of the realities of spiritual being, of which bodily states are but shadows, denying that what men call death deserves the name. ‘Death’ is the state of the soul separated from God, whether united to the body or no,-not the separation of body and soul, which is only a visible symbol of the more dread reality.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">IV. We have finally the life-giving word and the life-preserving care. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Probably Jesus first freed His progress from the jostling crowd, and then, when arrived, made the further selection of the three apostles,-the first three of the mighty ones-and, as was becoming, of the father and mother.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> With what hushed, tense expectation they would enter the chamber! Think of the mother’s eyes watching Him. The very words that He spoke were like a caress. There was infinite tenderness in that ‘Damsel!’ from His lips, and so deep an impression did it make on Peter that he repeated the very words to Mark, and used them, with the change of one letter {‘Ta<span class="ital">b</span>itha’ for ‘Ta<span class="ital">l</span>itha’}, in raising Dorcas. The same tenderness is expressed by His taking her by the hand, as, no doubt, her mother had done, many a morning, on waking her. The father had asked Him to lay His hand on her, that she might be made whole and live. He did as He was asked,-He always does-and His doing according to our desire brings larger blessings than we had thought of. Neither the touch of His hand nor the words He spoke were the real agents of the child’s returning to life. It was His will which brought her back from whatever vasty dimness she had entered. The forth-putting of Christ’s will is sovereign, and His word runs with power through all regions of the universe. ‘The dull, cold ear of death’ hears, and ‘they that hear shall live,’ whether they are, as men say, dead, or whether they are ‘dead in trespasses and sins.’ The resurrection of a soul is a mightier act-if we can speak of degrees of might in His acts-than that of a body.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It would be calming for the child of such strange experiences to see, for the first thing that met her eyes opening again on the old familiar home as on a strange land, the bending face of Jesus, and His touch would steady her spirit and assure of His love and help. The quiet command to give her food knits the wonder with common life, and teaches precious lessons as to His economy of miraculous power, like His bidding others loosen Lazarus’s wrappings, and as to His devolution on us of duties towards those whom He raises from the death of sin. But it was given, not didactically, but lovingly. The girl was exhausted, and sustenance was necessary, and would be sweet. So He thought upon a small bodily need, and the love that gave life took care to provide what was required to support it. He gives the greatest; He will take care that we shall not lack the least.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:35-43 We may suppose Jairus hesitating whether he should ask Christ to go on or not, when told that his daughter was dead. But have we not as much occasion for the grace of God, and the comfort of his Spirit, for the prayers of our ministers and Christian friends, when death is in the house, as when sickness is there? Faith is the only remedy against grief and fear at such a time. Believe the resurrection, then fear not. He raised the dead child to life by a word of power. Such is the gospel call to those who are by nature dead in trespasses and sins. It is by the word of Christ that spiritual life is given. All who saw it, and heard of it, admired the miracle, and Him that wrought it. Though we cannot now expect to have our dead children or relatives restored, we may hope to find comfort under our trials.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Why troublest thou ... - It seems that the people had not yet confidence that Jesus could raise the dead.

That he could not expect to be concealed had they yielded obedience, for his miracles were done openly, and it was not likely that all would keep silence, nay, he commanded the leper to go and show himself to the priests. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3.

The above things to the poor woman, in commendation of her faith, and for her future encouragement, peace, and comfort in soul and body: <p>there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain that said. The Vulgate Latin renders it, "from the ruler of the synagogue", and which is indeed the literal version of the phrase; but they could not come from him in person, for he was with Jesus: hence some versions, as the Arabic and Ethiopic, read, "there came to the ruler of the synagogue"; but the sense is easy, by supplying the word house, as we do, and as the Syriac and Persic versions also do. Luke speaks but of "one" that came, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-49.htm">Luke 8:49</a> whereas this evangelist suggests there were more, which is no contradiction; for Luke does not say there was but one; there might be more that came with the news, though but one related it as the mouth of the rest; or they might come one after another with it. <p>Which said, thy daughter is dead, why troublest thou the master any further? these brought him the account that his daughter was actually dead, which he himself feared before; and therefore they thought it was in vain to give Christ any further trouble to drag along through a crowd of people pressing him; whom they looked upon as a very worthy person, an eminent doctor and prophet, a master in Israel, and one that had done great cures on living persons in distress; yet imagined it was wholly out of his power to raise one from the dead, of which, as yet, they had had no instance, unless the raising of the widow of Nain's son was before this, as indeed it seems to be; but perhaps persons, who were some of the relations, or domestics of the ruler, had heard nothing of it; for if they had, they might have hoped he would have exerted his power in raising the ruler's daughter, as well as the widow's son. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/mark/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/5-35.htm" title="While he yet spoke, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Your daughter is dead: why trouble you the Master any further?...">Mark 5:35-43</a>.

When Jesus heals publicly in presence of the multitude there is not found even in Mark, except in the cases of the expulsion of <span class="ital">demons</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-34.htm" title="And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.">Mark 1:34</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-12.htm" title="And he straightly charged them that they should not make him known.">Mark 3:12</a>, any prohibition of the kind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-11.htm" title="I say to you, Arise, and take up your bed, and go your way into your house.">Mark 2:11</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-5.htm" title="And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he said to the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.">Mark 3:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-34.htm" title="And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you whole; go in peace, and be whole of your plague.">Mark 5:34</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-27.htm" title="But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.">Mark 9:27</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-52.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, Go your way; your faith has made you whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.">Mark 10:52</a>). Mark therefore ought not to have been subjected to the imputation of a tendency to make the sensation produced by the healings of Jesus “appear altogether great and important” (Köstlin, p. 317; comp. Baur, Markusevang. p. 54) by His design of wishing to hinder it; or of the endeavour to leave out of view the unsusceptible mass of the people, and to bestow His attention solely on the susceptible circle of the disciples (Hilgenfeld, <span class="ital">Evang.</span> p. 135). In our history the quickening to life again in itself could not, of course, be kept secret (see, on the contrary, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-26.htm" title="And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.">Matthew 9:26</a>), but probably the more detailed circumstances of the way of its accomplishment might. Jesus, although He was from the outset certain of being the promised Messiah (in opposition to Schenkel), by such prohibitions did <span class="ital">as much as on His part He could</span> to oppose the kindling of precipitate Messianic fanaticism and popular commotion. He could not prevent their want of success in individual cases (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-45.htm" title="But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.">Mark 1:45</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-36.htm" title="And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;">Mark 7:36</a>); but it is just the frequent occurrence of those prohibitions that gives so sure attestation of their historical character in general. Comp. Ewald, <span class="ital">Jahrb.</span> I. p. 117 f. It is quite as historical and characteristic, that Jesus never forbade the propagation of His <span class="ital">teachings</span>. With His <span class="ital">Messiahship</span> He was afraid of arousing a premature sensation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-30.htm" title="And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.">Mark 8:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-9.htm" title="And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.">Mark 9:9</a>; <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/5-35.htm" title="While he yet spoke, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Your daughter is dead: why trouble you the Master any further?...">Mark 5:35-43</a>. <span class="ital">The story of Jairus’ daughter resumed</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/mark/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">35–43</span>.

The ruler must have been agonized with the thought that, while our Lord lingered, the life of his dying child was fast ebbing away.  And now comes the fatal message to him. Thy daughter is dead (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>); the aorist expresses that her death was now a past event. <span class="cmt_word">Why troublest thou the Master any further?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). The Greek word here is very strong.
