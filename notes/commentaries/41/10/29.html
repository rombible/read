Those who thus eagerly seek the wealth of the world, will never rightly prize Christ and his grace. Also, as to the greatness of the salvation of those who have but little of this world, and leave it for Christ. The greatest trial of a good man's constancy is, when love to Jesus calls him to give up love to friends and relatives. Even when gainers by Christ, let them still expect to suffer for him, till they reach heaven. Let us learn contentment in a low state, and to watch against the love of riches in a high one. Let us pray to be enabled to part with all, if required, in Christ's service, and to use all we are allowed to keep in his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Out of measure - Very much, or exceedingly.

The word "wife" is left out in the Vulgate Latin version, perhaps because it is not repeated in the following verse; but all copies, and other versions have it; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-29.htm">Matthew 19:29</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-29.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said, Truly I say to you, There is no man that has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,">Mark 10:29</a>. Jesus, seeing Peter’s meaning, proceeds to give, first, a generous answer, then a word of warning. In the enumeration of persons and things forsaken, “wife” is omitted in important MSS. (W.H[97]). The omission is true to the delicate feeling of Jesus. It may have to be done, but He would rather not say it.—<span class="greekheb">τοῦ εὐαγγελίου</span>: a gloss to suit apostolic times and circumstances.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[97] Westcott and Hort.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-29.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said, Truly I say to you, There is no man that has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,">Mark 10:29</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἢ ἀδελφοὺς</span>, <span class="ital">or brethren</span>) The goods which are left (for Christ’s sake) are enumerated disjunctively [“house <span class="ital">or</span> brethren <span class="ital">or</span> sisters,” etc.]: the goods, which are granted in reward, are enumerated copulatively [“houses <span class="ital">and</span> brethren <span class="ital">and</span> sisters,” etc., <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-30.htm" title="But he shall receive an hundred times now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.">Mark 10:30</a>]: See following verse.

It may be that St. Matthew was guided to record it, inasmuch as his Gospel was written for Jews. Its omission by St. Mark and St. Luke may be explained by the fact that they were writing, the one to Romans, and the other to Gentiles generally. Omitting further notice here of this great promise recorded only by St. Matthew, St. Mark's words seem general, common to all faithful Christians. This leaving, of house, or <span class="cmt_word">brethren</span>, or <span class="cmt_word">sisters</span>, etc., might be rendered necessary from various causes. But they are all covered by that one expression, <span class="cmt_word">for my sake, and for the gospel's</span>. </body></html>
