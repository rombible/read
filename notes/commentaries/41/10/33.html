Worldly honour is a glittering thing, with which the eyes of Christ's own disciples have many times been dazzled. Our care must be, that we may have wisdom and grace to know how to suffer with him; and we may trust him to provide what the degrees of our glory shall be. Christ shows them that dominion was generally abused in the world. If Jesus would gratify all our desires, it would soon appear that we desire fame or authority, and are unwilling to taste of his cup, or to have his baptism; and should often be ruined by having our prayers answered. But he loves us, and will only give his people what is good for them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-17.htm">Matthew 20:17-19</a>.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-32.htm">Mark 10:32</a><p>Jesus went before him - In the manner of an intrepid, fearless leader and guide, exposing "himself" to danger and death rather than his followers.<p>And they rather amazed ... - They were afraid that evil would befall him in the city; that the scribes and Pharisees, who had so often sought to kill him, would then do it. Their fear and amazement were increased when he told them what would befall him there. They were amazed that, when he knew so well what would happen, he should still persevere in going up to the city. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33.

The Vulgate Latin version adds, "and to the elders"; but this is not in any of the copies, nor in other versions: <p>and they shall condemn him to death; as they did in the palace of the high priest, "nemine contradicente"; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-64.htm">Mark 14:64</a>, <p>and shall deliver him to the Gentiles; the Romans, to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor; either because they had not then power to put him to death themselves, or because they were desirous he should die the death of the cross, a Roman punishment. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-33.htm" title="Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests, and to the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:">Mark 10:33</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἰδοὺ</span>, etc.: the third prediction has for its specialties delivery to the Gentiles (<span class="greekheb">τοῖς ἔθνεσι</span>). and an exact specification of the indignities to be endured: mocking, spitting, scourging.
