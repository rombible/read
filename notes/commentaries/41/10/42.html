Worldly honour is a glittering thing, with which the eyes of Christ's own disciples have many times been dazzled. Our care must be, that we may have wisdom and grace to know how to suffer with him; and we may trust him to provide what the degrees of our glory shall be. Christ shows them that dominion was generally abused in the world. If Jesus would gratify all our desires, it would soon appear that we desire fame or authority, and are unwilling to taste of his cup, or to have his baptism; and should often be ruined by having our prayers answered. But he loves us, and will only give his people what is good for them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-20.htm">Matthew 20:20-28</a>.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-35.htm">Mark 10:35</a><p>And James and John ...came unto him - They did this through the instrumentality of their mother.

It is applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-16.htm" title="And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.">Acts 19:16</a> to the man possessed with an evil spirit <span class="ital">prevailing against</span> and <span class="ital">overcoming</span> the seven sons of Sceva. St Peter himself uses it in his first Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-3.htm" title="Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:">Mark 5:3</a>), recalling possibly this very incident, where he warns the elders of the Church “not to be <span class="ital">lords over</span> God’s heritage,” or as it is in the margin, “<span class="ital">to overrule.</span>” The preposition in the original is emphatic, and gives the force of oppressive, tyrannical rule, where the ruler uses his rights for the diminution of the ruled and the exaltation of himself. The same unfavourable sense attaches to the word rendered “<span class="ital">exercise authority,</span>” which only occurs here and in the parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-25.htm" title="But Jesus called them to him, and said, You know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority on them.">Matthew 20:25</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-42.htm" title="But Jesus called them to him, and said to them, You know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority on them.">Mark 10:42</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δοκοῦντες</span>) <span class="ital">they who think</span> [<span class="ital">which are accounted</span>, Engl.
