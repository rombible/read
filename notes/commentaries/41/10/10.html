Preaching was Christ's constant practice. He here shows that the reason why Moses' law allowed divorce, was such that they ought not to use the permission; it was only for the hardness of their hearts. God himself joined man and wife together; he has fitted them to be comforts and helps for each other. The bond which God has tied, is not to be lightly untied.

I am sure the reason is equal on both sides. The adultery of the husband dissolves the tie and covenant of marriage, as well as the adultery of the wife. It is yet a more groundless and unreasonable opinion of some from the words of this and the parallel texts, that persons divorced may not marry again; as if God’s end in the law of divorce in case of adultery were merely to separate the wife from the husband’s bed. Whether the person that hath given the cause for the divorce may marry again, may be more disputed, not only because such persons are dead persons in the law of God, but because such a liberty granted would open a flood gate to iniquity of that kind, while persons weary of their correlates should by this means gratify their lusts, and also obtain their desires. But I shall not determine it. Certain it is our Saviour here speaketh only of divorces for trivial causes, which the law of God doth not warrant; and in such cases the person marrying again must necessarily commit adultery, because the band of the former union holds.

The two evangelists differ from one another here in respect of the place, of the persons to whom Jesus is speaking, and partially of the contents of what He says. Certainly Matthew has furnished the original shape of the matter, since what Mark makes Jesus say only in the house and merely to His disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-11.htm" title="And he said to them, Whoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, commits adultery against her.">Mark 10:11</a> with the not original amplification of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-12.htm" title="And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she commits adultery.">Mark 10:12</a>) is withal an essential element of the reply to the Pharisees, and does not bear the character of a special private instruction, whereas the private communication to the disciples, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/19-10.htm" title="His disciples say to him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry....">Matthew 19:10-12</a>, which as such is just as appropriate as it is original, is indeed “the crown of the whole” (Ewald).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν</span>] <span class="ital">having come into the house</span> (in which at that time they were lodging).

The narrative of Mark is certainly not original (in opposition to Schenkel), but puts into the mouth of Jesus what was the custom among the <span class="ital">Greeks</span> and <span class="ital">Romans</span>, namely, that the wife also might be the divorcing party, and very often actually was so (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-13.htm" title="And the woman which has an husband that believes not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.">1 Corinthians 7:13</a>, and Wetstein <span class="ital">in loc.</span>; also Danz in Meuschen, <span class="ital">N.

R.</span> p. 806 f.) do not belong to the question here, where the wife herself is the party who puts away. The proposition in the passage before us is derived from an <span class="ital">Hellenic</span> amplification of the tradition,[133] which, however, in Matthew is again excluded. Comp. Harless, p. 25f. According to Kuinoel (comp. Lange), Jesus purposed to give to the apostles, as future teachers of the <span class="ital">Gentiles</span>, the instruction requisite for judging in such a case. But He must have <span class="ital">said</span> as much, as the <span class="ital">question</span> had reference to the <span class="ital">Jewish</span> relation of divorce.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μοιχᾶται</span>] the subject is the <span class="ital">woman</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-11.htm" title="Now there was there near to the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.">Mark 5:11</a>), not the <span class="greekheb">ἄλλος</span>. Moreover, Grotius appropriately says: “Mulier ergo, cum domina sui non sit … omnino adulterium committit, non interpretatione aliqua aut per consequentiam, sed directe. Ideo non debuit hic addi <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠʼ ΑὐΤΌΝ</span></span></span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[132] Observe that Jesus here of necessity presupposes the acknowledgment of the principle of <span class="ital">monogamy</span>. Theophylact and many others, including Lange, Ewald, and Bleek, have erroneously referred <span class="greekheb">αὐτήν</span> to the <span class="ital">second</span> wife. Erasmus appropriately says: “in injuriam illius.” Comp. Calvin and Bengel: “in illam.” It is only thus that its emphatic bearing is brought out; the marrying of the <span class="ital">second</span> wife makes him an adulterer towards the <span class="ital">first</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[133] According to Baur, from a <span class="ital">reflection</span> of Mark on the equal rights of the two sexes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/10-10.htm" title="And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter....">Mark 10:10-12</a> report as spoken to the Twelve <span class="ital">in the house</span> (as opposed to the <span class="ital">way</span> in which the Pharisees are supposed to have encountered Jesus) what in Mt.’s version appears as the last word to the interrogants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-9.htm" title="What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder.">Mark 10:9</a>). Two variations are noticeable: (1) the absence of the qualifying clause <span class="greekheb">εἰ μὴ ἐπὶ πορνείᾳ</span>, and (2) the addition of a clause (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-12.htm" title="And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she commits adultery.">Mark 10:12</a>) stating the law in its bearing on the woman = if she put away her husband and marry another, she is an adulteress. In the former case Mk. probably reports correctly what Christ said, in the latter he has added a gloss so as to make Christ’s teaching a guide for his Gentile readers. Jewish women could not divorce their husbands. The <span class="greekheb">ἐπʼ αὐτήν</span> at the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-11.htm" title="And he said to them, Whoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, commits adultery against her.">Mark 10:11</a> may mean either against, to the prejudice of, her (the first wife), or with her (the second). The former view is taken by the leading modern exegetes, the latter by Victor Ant., Euthy., Theophy., and, among moderns, Ewald and Bleek.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/mark/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">in the house</span>] St Mark records several confidential household words of our Lord to His disciples, e.g. concerning (<span class="ital">a</span>) the power of casting out demons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/9-28.htm" title="And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?...">Mark 9:28-29</a>); (<span class="ital">b</span>) the great in the kingdom of heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/9-33.htm" title="And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that you disputed among yourselves by the way?...">Mark 9:33-37</a>); and (<span class="ital">c</span>) here, the Christian law of marriage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div>[10. <span class="greekheb">Πάλιν</span>, <span class="ital">again</span>) The Saviour had given the reply which follows to the <span class="ital">Pharisees</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-9.htm" title="And I say to you, Whoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, commits adultery: and whoever marries her which is put away does commit adultery.">Matthew 19:9</a>; but the <span class="ital">disciples</span>, by repeating the question, called forth a repetition of the same reply.—V. g.]<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - The discussion with the Pharisees, related in the previous verses, had taken place in public.
