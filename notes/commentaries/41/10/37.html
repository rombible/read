Worldly honour is a glittering thing, with which the eyes of Christ's own disciples have many times been dazzled. Our care must be, that we may have wisdom and grace to know how to suffer with him; and we may trust him to provide what the degrees of our glory shall be. Christ shows them that dominion was generally abused in the world. If Jesus would gratify all our desires, it would soon appear that we desire fame or authority, and are unwilling to taste of his cup, or to have his baptism; and should often be ruined by having our prayers answered. But he loves us, and will only give his people what is good for them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-20.htm">Matthew 20:20-28</a>.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-35.htm">Mark 10:35</a><p>And James and John ...came unto him - They did this through the instrumentality of their mother.
