Preaching was Christ's constant practice. He here shows that the reason why Moses' law allowed divorce, was such that they ought not to use the permission; it was only for the hardness of their hearts.

Of the world, or of man:   , "from the beginning of the creation of the world", is a way of speaking often used by the Jews (r): the phrase "of the creation" is left out in the Syriac and Persic versions; and so it was in Beza's most ancient copy, and it is only read, "from the beginning", as in Mat_19:4,8; see Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4</a>,  See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8</a>. <p>God made them male and female; the first that were created, Adam and Eve, the first parents of mankind, the first couple that came together were one male and one female; so that there could be no polygamy or divorce: Adam could not have more wives than one: nor could he put away Eve, and marry another; no provision was made for any such usages and practices; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4</a>.
