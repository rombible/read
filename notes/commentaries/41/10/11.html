He here shows that the reason why Moses' law allowed divorce, was such that they ought not to use the permission; it was only for the hardness of their hearts.

Let those who are for putting away their wives consider what would become of themselves, if God should deal with them in like manner.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this question about divorce explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-1.htm">Matthew 19:1-12</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 10<p>Mr 10:1-12.
