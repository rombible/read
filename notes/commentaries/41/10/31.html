Those who thus eagerly seek the wealth of the world, will never rightly prize Christ and his grace. Also, as to the greatness of the salvation of those who have but little of this world, and leave it for Christ. The greatest trial of a good man's constancy is, when love to Jesus calls him to give up love to friends and relatives. Even when gainers by Christ, let them still expect to suffer for him, till they reach heaven. Let us learn contentment in a low state, and to watch against the love of riches in a high one. Let us pray to be enabled to part with all, if required, in Christ's service, and to use all we are allowed to keep in his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>An hundred-fold - One hundred times as much.<p>In this time - In this life. In the time that he forsakes all.<p>Houses ... - This cannot be taken literally, as promising a hundred times as many "mothers, sisters," etc. It means, evidently, that the loss shall be a hundred times "compensated" or made up; or that, in the possession of religion, we have a hundred times the "value" of all we forsake. This consists in the pardon of sin, in the favor of God, in peace of conscience, in support in trials and in death, and in raising up "friends" in the place of those who are left - "spiritual brethren, and sisters, and mothers," etc. And this corresponds to the experience of all who ever became Christians. At the same time. it is true that godliness is profitable "for all things," having the promise of the life that is, as well as of that which is to come. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>. "The favor of God" is the security for every blessing. Obedience to his law secures industry, temperance, chastity, economy, prudence, health, and the confidence of the world - all indispensable to success in life, and all connected. commonly, with success. Though the wicked "sometimes" prosper, yet the "surest" way of prosperity is to fear God and keep his commandments. Thus will all "needed" blessings descend on us "here," and "eternal" blessings hereafter.<p>With persecutions - Persecutions, or the contempt of the world, and bodily sufferings on account of their religion, they "must" meet. Jesus did not conceal this; but he consoled them. He assured them that "amid" these, or perhaps it should be rendered "after" these, they should find friends and comfort. It is well to bear trial if "God" be our Friend. With the promises of the Bible in our hand, we may hail persecutions, and thank God that, amid so many sorrows, he has furnished such abundant consolations. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 10:17-31.

Most fitly does our Lord add this weighty sentence to what has just gone before. For thus he places himself, his grace, and his gospel in direct opposition to the corrupt teaching of the scribes and Pharisees. Perhaps the disciples thought within themselves, "How can it come to pass that we, the poor, the unlearned, the despised, are to sit upon thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel, amongst whom are men far our superiors in station, in learning, and in authority, such as are the scribes and Pharisees, and that rich young ruler just mentioned." Our Lord here teaches them that the future will reveal great changes - that some who are first here will be last there, and some who seem last here will be first there. The disciples, and others like them, who, having forsaken all and followed Christ, seemed to be last in this world, will be first in the world to come - most dear to Christ, the King of Heaven, in their lives; most like to him in their zeal for his cause. </body></html>
