By the special benignity of his Providence, they shall have every thing valuable that relations or possessions could administer to them. And, besides, shall have <span class="ital">persecutions, </span>whose heat will nourish virtues in them of such excellent efficacy, as to yield them, even in this present world, joys a hundred times better than all earthly pleasures; so that they shall be fed by the bread of sorrows. But, above all, in the world to come they shall have everlasting life. Their afflictions contributing to the growth of their graces, which are the wings of the soul, they shall in due time be raised on them even up to heaven, leaving all sorrows behind them, and shall fly swiftly into the bosom of God, the fountain of life and joy, where they shall have full amends made them for all the evils they had undergone on account of Christ and his gospel.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">But many that are first, </span>&c.

Those who thus eagerly seek the wealth of the world, will never rightly prize Christ and his grace. Also, as to the greatness of the salvation of those who have but little of this world, and leave it for Christ. The greatest trial of a good man's constancy is, when love to Jesus calls him to give up love to friends and relatives. Even when gainers by Christ, let them still expect to suffer for him, till they reach heaven. Let us learn contentment in a low state, and to watch against the love of riches in a high one. Let us pray to be enabled to part with all, if required, in Christ's service, and to use all we are allowed to keep in his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Out of measure - Very much, or exceedingly.

Our Saviour having blessed the poor, especially such as had stripped themselves of all for his sake and the gospel’s, Peter raised up hopes to himself, who had no riches to trust in or have his heart cleave unto, and had stripped himself of all that little he had to follow Christ. Christ assures him that neither he, nor any other that had done so, should by it lose any thing; for though in this life they should have persecutions, yet they should be amply rewarded in value, if not in kind, in this world, and with infinite happiness in the next. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then Peter began to say unto him,.... only observing that Christ promised treasure in heaven to the young man, provided he sold all that he had, and gave it to the poor; but being, in some measure, freed from that surprise and astonishment, which had seized him, and his fellow disciples, at the representation of the difficulty of a rich man's entering into the kingdom of God, by the last words; and taking heart from thence, began to take notice of the following case, as an instance and illustration of what Christ had said; for that same power, which had caused them to quit all their worldly substance for Christ, though it was but small, could also work a like effect upon the heart of a man ever so rich: <p>lo! we have left all, and have followed thee: in Matthew it is added, "what shall we have therefore?"

See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-29.htm" title="And every one that has forsaken houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundred times, and shall inherit everlasting life.">Matthew 19:29</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἤρξατο</span>] “spe ex verbis salvatoris concepta,” Bengel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The question in Matthew, <span class="greekheb">τί ἄρα ἔσται ἡμ</span>., is obvious of itself, even although unexpressed (not omitted by Mark in the Petrine interest, as Hilgenfeld thinks), and Jesus understood it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-29.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said, Truly I say to you, There is no man that has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,">Mark 10:29</a> f. The logical link of the two clauses is: <span class="ital">No one has forsaken,</span> etc., <span class="ital">if he shall not have</span> (at some time) <span class="ital">received, i.e.</span> if the latter event does not occur, the former has not taken place; the hundredfold compensation is so certain, that its non-occurrence would presuppose the not having forsaken. The association of thought in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-22.htm" title="For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.">Mark 4:22</a> (not in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-42.htm" title="He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, your will be done.">Matthew 26:42</a>) is altogether similar. Instead of the <span class="greekheb">ἤ</span>, there is introduced in the second half of the clause <span class="greekheb">καί</span>; which is: <span class="ital">and respectively</span>. The <span class="ital">principle of division</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-30.htm" title="But he shall receive an hundred times now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.">Mark 10:30</a> is: He is (1) to receive a hundredfold now, in the period prior to the manifestation of the Messiah, namely, a hundred times as many houses, brothers, etc.; and (2) to receive in the coming period (“jam in adventu est,” Bengel), after the Parousia, the everlasting life of the Messiah’s kingdom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">plurals</span>, which express the number a hundred, plainly show that the promised compensation in the <span class="greekheb">καιρὸς οὗτος</span> is not to be understood literally, but generally, of <span class="ital">very abundant compensation</span>. Nevertheless, the delicate feeling of Jesus has not said <span class="greekheb">γυναῖκας</span> also. So much the more clumsy was Julian’s scoff (see Theophylact) that the Christians were, moreover, to receive a hundred wives! The promise was <span class="ital">realized</span>, in <span class="ital">respect</span> of the <span class="greekheb">καιρὸς οὗτος</span>, by the reciprocal <span class="ital">manifestations of love</span>,[138] and by the wealth in <span class="ital">spiritual</span> possessions, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/6-8.htm" title="By honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;...">2 Corinthians 6:8-10</a>; by which passage is illustrated, at the same time, in a noble example, the <span class="greekheb">μετὰ</span> διωγμε͂<span class="greekheb">ν</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-10.htm" title="Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:10</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-23.htm" title="But when they persecute you in this city, flee you into another: for truly I say to you, You shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.">Matthew 10:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-21.htm" title="Yet has he not root in himself, but endures for a while: for when tribulation or persecution rises because of the word, by and by he is offended.">Matthew 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-34.htm" title="Why, behold, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them you shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall you whip in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:">Matthew 23:34</a>).

A doctrine assuredly, which, after the general promise of the great recompense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-29.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said, Truly I say to you, There is no man that has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,">Mark 10:29</a> f., was quite in its place to furnish a wholesome check to the ebullition of greediness for reward in the question of the disciples, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-28.htm" title="Then Peter began to say to him, See, we have left all, and have followed you.">Mark 10:28</a> (for the <span class="ital">disciples</span>, doubtless, belonged to the <span class="greekheb">πρῶτοι</span>).

It is probable that the sacrifice which Peter and the rest of the disciples had made when they became his followers, was small, compared with the sacrifice which our Lord demanded of the rich young ruler. Nevertheless they forsook their all, whatever it was. They had forsaken their boats and their nets. They had forsaken their means of subsistence. They had forsaken things which, though they were not much in themselves, were nevertheless such things as they would have desired to keep. Cornelins a Lapide says, "Such things are forsaken by those who follow Christ, as are capable of being desired by those who do not follow him." St. Augustine says, "St. Peter not only forsook what he had, but also what he desired to have. But who does not desire daily to increase what he has? That desire is cut off. Peter forsook the whole world, and he received in return the whole world. They were as those who had nothing, and yet were possessing all things." </body></html>
