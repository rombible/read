Worldly honour is a glittering thing, with which the eyes of Christ's own disciples have many times been dazzled. Our care must be, that we may have wisdom and grace to know how to suffer with him; and we may trust him to provide what the degrees of our glory shall be. Christ shows them that dominion was generally abused in the world. If Jesus would gratify all our desires, it would soon appear that we desire fame or authority, and are unwilling to taste of his cup, or to have his baptism; and should often be ruined by having our prayers answered. But he loves us, and will only give his people what is good for them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-17.htm">Matthew 20:17-19</a>.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-32.htm">Mark 10:32</a><p>Jesus went before him - In the manner of an intrepid, fearless leader and guide, exposing "himself" to danger and death rather than his followers.<p>And they rather amazed ... - They were afraid that evil would befall him in the city; that the scribes and Pharisees, who had so often sought to kill him, would then do it. Their fear and amazement were increased when he told them what would befall him there. They were amazed that, when he knew so well what would happen, he should still persevere in going up to the city. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34. And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again&#8212;Singularly explicit as this announcement was, Luke (Lu 18:34) says "they understood none of these things; and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken." The meaning of the words they could be at no loss to understand, but their import in relation to His Messianic kingdom they could not penetrate; the whole prediction being right in the teeth of their preconceived notions. That they should have clung so tenaciously to the popular notion of an "unsuffering" Messiah, may surprise us; but it gives inexpressible weight to their after-testimony to a suffering and dying Saviour.<p>Ambitious Request of James and John&#8212;The Reply (Mr 10:35-45).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/mark/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-32.htm" title="And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid.

The Gentiles, as the Roman soldiers did; the one at the connivance, and the other by the order of their governor: <p>and shall spit upon him; on his face, as the Syriac and Persic versions render it, and as they did; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-19.htm">Mark 15:19</a>. This clause is placed by the Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, between the two former; though, according to the order in which these things were executed, he was first scourged, then mocked, and then spit upon: all which express both the cruel and indecent usage he was to meet with: <p>and shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise again. The Persic version between these two clauses read, "and shall put him in a grave"; which is not in any copy of this text, nor in any other version; nor indeed was this done by the Gentiles, but by Joseph of Arimathea. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/mark/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">34</span>. <span class="ital">and shall kill him</span>] Or, as St Matthew adds, “<span class="ital">crucify Him</span>.” Now for the first time is revealed this last, this greatest horror (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-19.htm" title="And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to whip, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.">Matthew 20:19</a>).

This absence of all sympathy was one of His greatest trials.</body></html>
