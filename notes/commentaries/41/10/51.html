Saul asks the second question of Jesus, and the answer is a command. Different as they are, we may bring them together. The one is the voice of love, desiring to be besought in order that it may bestow; the other is the voice of love, desiring to be commanded in order that it may obey.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Love delights in knowing, expressing, and fulfilling the beloved’s wishes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The communion of Love delights on both sides in knowing the beloved’s wishes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Christ delights in knowing ours.

Be sure that He does still delight to give us our desires, and so be sure that when any of these are not granted there must be some loving reason for refusal.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Our delight should be in obedience, and only when our wills are submitted to His does He say to us, ‘What wilt thou?’ ‘If ye abide in Me and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you.’<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:46-52 Bartimeus had heard of Jesus and his miracles, and learning that he was passing by, hoped to recover his eyesight. In coming to Christ for help and healing, we should look to him as the promised Messiah. The gracious calls Christ gives us to come to him, encourage our hope, that if we come to him we shall have what we come for. Those who would come to Jesus, must cast away the garment of their own sufficiency, must free themselves from every weight, and the sin that, like long garments, most easily besets them, Heb 12:1. He begged that his eyes might be opened. It is very desirable to be able to earn our bread; and where God has given men limbs and senses, it is a shame, by foolishness and slothfulness, to make themselves, in effect, blind and lame. His eyes were opened. Thy faith has made thee whole: faith in Christ as the Son of David, and in his pity and power; not thy repeated words, but thy faith; Christ setting thy faith to work. Let sinners be exhorted to imitate blind Bartimeus. Where the gospel is preached, or the written words of truth circulated, Jesus is passing by, and this is the opportunity. It is not enough to come to Christ for spiritual healing, but, when we are healed, we must continue to follow him; that we may honour him, and receive instruction from him. Those who have spiritual eyesight, see that beauty in Christ which will draw them to run after him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Casting away his garment - That is, his outer garment - the one that was thrown loosely over him. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-40.htm">Matthew 5:40</a>. He threw it off, full of joy at the prospect of being healed, and that he might run without impediment to Jesus. This may be used to illustrate - though it had no such original reference - the manner in which a sinner should come to Jesus. He should throw away the garments of his own righteousness - he should rise speedily - should run with joy - should have full faith in the power of Jesus, and cast himself entirely upon his mercy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 10:46-52.

"Rabboni," or "Rabbuni," means literally, <span class="accented">my Master</span>. It was a more respectful mode of address than the more simple form "Rabbi." This expression shows that Bartimaeus had yet much to learn as to the Divine character of our Lord. But his faith is accepted; and he showed that it was genuine as far as it went, by forthwith following Jesus in the way. There were six occasions on which our Lord is recorded to have healed the blind: St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-27.htm">Matthew 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-22.htm">Matthew 12:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-14.htm">Matthew 21:14</a>); St. Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-24.htm">Mark 8:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-46.htm">Mark 10:46</a>); St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1</a>). St. Chrysostom says of Bartimaeus, that as before this gift of healing he showed perseverance, so after it he shewed gratitude. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </body></html>
