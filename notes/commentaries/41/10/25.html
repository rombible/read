Those who thus eagerly seek the wealth of the world, will never rightly prize Christ and his grace. Also, as to the greatness of the salvation of those who have but little of this world, and leave it for Christ. The greatest trial of a good man's constancy is, when love to Jesus calls him to give up love to friends and relatives. Even when gainers by Christ, let them still expect to suffer for him, till they reach heaven. Let us learn contentment in a low state, and to watch against the love of riches in a high one. Let us pray to be enabled to part with all, if required, in Christ's service, and to use all we are allowed to keep in his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Children - An expression of affection, perhaps also implying a reproof that their slowness of understanding was like that of children.

In this proverbial saying the evangelists vary in expression in reference to the needle and the needle-eye, though one might have looked for stereotyped phraseology in a proverb. The fact points to different Greek renderings of a saying originally given in a Semitic tongue.—<span class="greekheb">τρυμαλιᾶς</span>, from <span class="greekheb">τρύω</span>, to rub through, so as to make a hole. According to Furrer, proverbs about the camel and the needle-eye, to express the impossible, are still current among the Arabs. <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, “hypocrites go into paradise as easily as a camel through a needle-eye”; “He asks of people that they conduct a camel through a needle-eye” (<span class="ital">Wanderungen</span>, p. 339).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/mark/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. <span class="ital">It is easier for a camel</span>] This figure has been variously interpreted. (<span class="ital">a</span>) Some have rendered it an “anchor-rope,” as though the word was “<span class="ital">kamilon</span>” and not “<span class="ital">kamelon;</span>” (<span class="ital">b</span>) others think it refers to the side gate for foot passengers, close by the principal gate, called in the East the “eye of a needle;” but (<span class="ital">c</span>) it is best to understand the words literally. Similar proverbs are common in the Talmud.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is easier for a camel to go</span> <span class="cmt_word">through a needle's eye,</span> etc. This is a strong hyperbolic proverbial expression to represent anything that is very difficult to do. Dr. John Lightfoot, in his Hebrew exercitations upon St. Matthew's Gospel (vol. 2 p. 219). He quotes instances from the binical writings of a very similar phrase intended to represent something that is  possible. For example, he quotes one rabbi disputing with another, who says, "Perhaps thou art one of those who can make an elephant pass through the eye of a needle; that i,s, "who speak things that are impossible.' St. Jerome says," It is not the absolute impossibility of the thing which is set forth, but the infrequency of it." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/10.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Needle (&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>A word stigmatized by the grammarians as unclassical.
