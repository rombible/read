Its obvious drift was to force him back upon the conditions of absolute goodness, to make him ask himself how far, and under what conditions, that word might be used relatively of any child of man.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:17-22 This young ruler showed great earnestness. He asked what he should do now, that he might be happy for ever. Most ask for good to be had in this world; any good, Ps 4:6; he asks for good to be done in this world, in order to enjoy the greatest good in the other world. Christ encouraged this address by assisting his faith, and by directing his practice. But here is a sorrowful parting between Jesus and this young man. He asks Christ what he shall do more than he has done, to obtain eternal life; and Christ puts it to him, whether he has indeed that firm belief of, and that high value for eternal life which he seems to have. Is he willing to bear a present cross, in expectation of future crown? The young man was sorry he could not be a follower of Christ upon easier terms; that he could not lay hold on eternal life, and keep hold of his worldly possessions too. He went away grieved.

This is said, not as denying that he was good, or as being angry with him for calling him so, but in order to lead this young man to a true knowledge of him, and his goodness, and even of his proper deity: <p>there is none good, but one, that is, God; some render it, "but one God", as the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions; and so the words are a proof of the unity of the divine being, and agree with <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, but are not to be understood to the exclusion of the Son and Spirit, who, with the Father, are the one God: nor do these words at all militate against the deity of Christ, or prove that he is not God, as the Jew objects (a); seeing this is not to be understood of the person of the Father, in opposition to the Son and Spirit, who are equally good: nor does Christ, in these words, deny himself to be God, but rather tacitly suggests it; since he is good in the same sense in which God is good: in Matthew it is added, "but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments", <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-17.htm">Matthew 19:17</a>, this Christ said not as his sense, that the way to eternal life lies in keeping the commandments of the law; but he speaks in the language of the Pharisees, and of this man; and his view is, to bring him to a sense of the impossibility of obtaining eternal life by these things, as the sequel shows: wherefore the above Jew (b) has no reason to confront the followers of Jesus with this passage, as if it was a concession of his, that it is impossible any should be saved without keeping the commands of the law of Moses. <p>(a) R.

He acted the part of a traveller and a pilgrim in the world; and in that condition, in which the Psalms describe Him as <span class="ital">wretched and needy</span>, He was ever aiming towards the eternal good and the eternal joy, concerning which this youth was enquiring. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-2.htm" title="O my soul, you have said to the LORD, You are my Lord: my goodness extends not to you;">Psalm 16:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-5.htm" title="The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: you maintain my lot.">Psalm 16:5</a>, etc.: <span class="ital">My goodness</span> [<span class="ital">extendeth not to thee</span>, Engl.

He did not “know Himself according to the flesh;” as Augustine preaches [distinctly states], l. i. de Doctr. Christ., c. 34. For <span class="ital">good</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθὸς</span>, properly applies to one blessed.[12] The young man was seeking with [by application to] Jesus happiness, in a too pure [unalloyed] sense. Jesus informs Him that ne will not find this with Him: Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-57.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said to him, Lord, I will follow you wherever you go.">Luke 9:57</a>, etc. Nevertheless He does not say, <span class="ital">I am not good</span>; but, <span class="ital">Why dost thou call Me good</span>? Just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-43.htm" title="He said to them, How then does David in spirit call him Lord, saying,">Matthew 22:43</a>, He does not deny, that He, the Son of David, is at one and the same time also the Lord of David. God is good: there is no goodness without Godhead. The young man perceived in Jesus the presence of goodness in some degree otherwise he would not have applied to Him: but he did not perceive it in its full extent; otherwise he would not have gone back from Him. Much less did he perceive [recognise] His Godhead. Wherefore Jesus does not accept from Him the title of goodness without the title of Godhead (Comp. the “<span class="ital">Why</span> call ye me, Lord, Lord,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-46.htm" title="And why call you me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?">Luke 6:46</a>): and thereby vindicates the honour of the Father, with whom He is one. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-19.htm" title="Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise.">John 5:19</a>. At the same time [He darts causes to enter] a ray of His omniscience into the heart of this young man, and shows that the young man has not as yet the knowledge concerning Himself, Jesus Christ, worthy of so exalted a title, which otherwise is altogether appropriate to Him. Wherefore He does not say, <span class="ital">There is none good save one, that is, My Father</span>; but, <span class="ital">There is none good save one, that is, God</span>. Often our Lord proportioned [qualified] His words to the capacity of those who questioned Him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-22.htm" title="You worship you know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.">John 4:22</a>. So a warlike commander, of noble birth, might answer to a person, who Knew not his noble birth, though knowing the fact of his a being commander, <span class="ital">Why do you call me, a gracious lord</span>? Jesus manifested His goodness to the disciples, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-23.htm" title="And he turned him to his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see:">Luke 10:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-16.htm" title="Let not then your good be evil spoken of:">Romans 14:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[12] Beatum, a term appropriate in the full sense only to God.—ED, and TRANSL.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why callest</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou me good</span>? According to the best authorities, the words in St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-17.htm">Matthew 21:17</a>) run thus: "Why askest thou me concerning that which is good? One there is who is good." The word "good" is the pivot on which our Lord's answer turns, both in St. Matthew and here. The question is doubtless put to test the young ruler's faith. If, as may be supposed, the young man used the term, "good Master," as a mere conventional expression, it was not the proper epithet to apply to our Lord, who at once transfers the praise and the goodness to God, that he might teach us to do the same. This ruler, by his mode of accosting our Lord, showed that he had not as yet a right faith in him - that he did not believe in his Godhead. Our Lord, therefore, desired to rouse him and lift him up to a higher faith. He seems to say to him, "If you call me good, believe that I am God; for no one is good, intrinsically good, but God. God alone is essentially good, and wise, and powerful, and holy. It is from him that angels and men derive a few drops, or rather some faint adumbration, of his goodness. There is none essentially, entirely, absolutely good but one, that is, God. Therefore seek after him, love him, imitate him. He alone can satisfy your longing desires, as in this life with his grace, so in the life to come with his glory; yea, with himself. For in heaven he manifested himself as the supreme good, to be tasted and enjoyed by the blessed for ever." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/10.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Why callest thou, etc<p>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-17.htm">Matthew 19:17</a>.
