To have inflicted such a punishment as this on any <span class="ital">free Jew, </span>would probably have been sufficient to have thrown the whole city and nation into an uproar; but now they were deaf to every thing but the clamour of passion, and in their madness did not consider with how dangerous a precedent they might furnish the Roman governor. And indeed it turned dreadfully on themselves, when such vast numbers of them were crucified for their opposition to the Romans during the time of their last war. See Doddridge, and note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-25.htm" title="Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.">Matthew 27:25</a>. <span class="ital">Pilate said, Why, what evil hath he done? </span>— What crime do you accuse him of? But instead of showing that he had done any evil, or specifying any one crime of which he had been guilty; <span class="ital">they </span>only <span class="ital">cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him </span>— See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-23.htm" title="And the governor said, Why, what evil has he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.">Matthew 27:23</a>. <span class="ital">Pilate, </span>therefore, <span class="ital">willing to content the people </span>— To whom, as appears from Josephus, he had given much cause of disgust before; being perhaps afraid of an insurrection if he should continue to withstand them, though at the head of an armed force sufficient to have quelled any mob, weakly suffered himself to be borne down by their violence; <span class="ital">and released unto them him that for sedition and murder had been cast into prison, whom they desired; but delivered Jesus to their will, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-25.htm" title="And he released to them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.">Luke 23:25</a>, namely, <span class="ital">delivered him to be crucified, when he had scourged him! “Whipping, </span>or <span class="ital">scourging, </span>was a punishment frequently used by the Jews and Romans. The Jews commonly inflicted it by a whip of three cords, and limited the number of stripes to thirty-nine, that they might not exceed the number limited. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-3.htm" title="Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then your brother should seem vile to you.">Deuteronomy 25:3</a>. But the usual way of scourging among the Romans was with such rods or wands as the lictors carried in a bundle before the magistrates; and they were exceeding cruel in this kind of punishment, tearing with their scourges even the veins and arteries, and laying the very bowels of the malefactors bare; and as our Saviour was scourged at Pilate’s order, it was done most probably by <span class="ital">his officers, </span>after the Roman manner, and was therefore no less severe than disgraceful.” See Calmet, and note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-26.htm" title="Then released he Barabbas to them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.">Matthew 27:26</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-14 They bound Christ. It is good for us often to remember the bonds of the Lord Jesus, as bound with him who was bound for us. By delivering up the King, they, in effect, delivered up the kingdom of God, which was, therefore, as by their own consent, taken from them, and given to another nation. Christ gave Pilate a direct answer, but would not answer the witnesses, because the things they alleged were known to be false, even Pilate himself was convinced they were so. Pilate thought that he might appeal from the priests to the people, and that they would deliver Jesus out of the priests' hands. But they were more and more urged by the priests, and cried, Crucify him! Crucify him! Let us judge of persons and things by their merits, and the standard of God's word, and not by common report. The thought that no one ever was so shamefully treated, as the only perfectly wise, holy, and excellent Person that ever appeared on earth, leads the serious mind to strong views of man's wickedness and enmity to God. Let us more and more abhor the evil dispositions which marked the conduct of these persecutors.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the principal events in this chapter explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27.htm">Matthew 27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 15<p>Mr 15:1-20.

The Persic version, as before, reads, "the chief of the priests"; but they were all concerned, and were the most active men in bringing about the death of Christ; though Caiaphas was behind none of them in envy, rage, and malice; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-20.htm">Matthew 27:20</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/15.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-11.htm" title="But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.">Mark 15:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνέσεισαν</span>, the aorist implies that the priests stirred up the people <span class="ital">with success</span>, to the effect that their request to Pilate was in favour of Barabbas. One may wonder how they so easily gained their purpose. But Barabbas, as described by Mk., represented a popular passion, which was stronger than any sympathy they might have for so unworldly a character as Jesus—the passion for <span class="ital">political liberty</span>. The priests would know how to play on that feeling. What unprincipled characters they were! They accuse Jesus to Pilate of political ambition, and they recommend Barabbas to the people for the same reason. But a “holy” end sanctifies the means!

His feelings, therefore, of awe were intensified, and his resolve to effect the release increased. But the chief priests stirred up the people, and urged them to choose Barabbas, the patriot leader, the zealot for their country, the champion against oppression.
