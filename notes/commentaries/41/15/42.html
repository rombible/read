The Jews spoke of two evenings, (see notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-15.htm" title="And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.">Matthew 14:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-23.htm" title="And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.">Matthew 14:23</a>.) It is probably the former of these that is meant here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-57.htm" title="When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:">Matthew 27:57</a>; for at six the preparation ended, and the sabbath began, when they were no longer at liberty to be employed in the manner mentioned in the subsequent verses. Therefore, that the bodies might not be hanging on the sabbath day, (or after six that evening,) they were in haste to have them taken down. <span class="ital">Joseph, an honourable counsellor</span> — A man of character and reputation, and a member of the sanhedrim; <span class="ital">who himself waited for the kingdom of God </span>— Who expected to see it set up on earth under the Messiah, and to partake of the blessings of it. Observe, reader, those who wait for the kingdom of God, and hope to obtain an interest in the privileges of it, must show it by their forwardness to own Christ’s cause even then, when it seems to be run down and crushed: <span class="ital">came and went in boldly unto Pilate </span>— Though he knew such an action must necessarily draw upon him the enmity and contempt of his brethren; <span class="ital">and craved the body of Jesus </span>— That he might preserve it from further insults, and bestow on it an honourable interment. Probably, as Dr. Doddridge observes, the prodigies attending Christ’s death, had been the means of awakening this rich and noble senator to greater courage than he had possessed before, and of inducing him thus to stand forth and publicly own his friendship to Jesus in the midst of his greatest infamy; which certainly was a courageous act at such a time, and in such a situation of affairs. <span class="ital">And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead </span>— For though he had given orders to break the legs of the crucified persons, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/19-31.htm" title="The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) sought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away....">John 19:31-32</a>, he knew that they might live some hours in that condition: <span class="ital">and calling </span>the centurion, <span class="ital">he asked whether he had been any while dead </span>— Whether it was so long since they perceived any sign of life in him, that they might conclude he was actually dead, past recall. It was through the special providence of God, that Pilate was so strict in examining into this matter, that there might be no pretence for saying that he was taken down from the cross and placed in the tomb while he was yet alive; and so for disproving his resurrection. And the reality of his death was so fully determined, that an objection of that kind was never started. Thus the truth of Christ sometimes obtains confirmation even from its enemies.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:42-47 We are here attending the burial of our Lord Jesus. Oh that we may by grace be planted in the likeness of it! Joseph of Arimathea was one who waited for the kingdom of God. Those who hope for a share in its privileges, must own Christ's cause, when it seems to be crushed. This man God raised up for his service. There was a special providence, that Pilate should be so strict in his inquiry, that there might be no pretence to say Jesus was alive. Pilate gave Joseph leave to take down the body, and do what he pleased with it. Some of the women beheld where Jesus was laid, that they might come after the sabbath to anoint the dead body, because they had not time to do it before. Special notice was taken of Christ's sepulchre, because he was to rise again. And he will not forsake those who trust in him, and call upon him. Death, deprived of its sting, will soon end the believer's sorrows, as it ended those of the Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The even - The time after three o'clock in the afternoon.<p>The Preparation ... - The following day was to be a day of special solemnity, called the "great day" of the feast.

Another reading is <span class="greekheb">ἡ Ἰωσήφ</span>, which occurs in A, 258, Vulg. Gat. Prag. Rd., and is preferred by Wieseler, chronol. Synopse, p. 427 f., who here understands the daughter or wife of the counsellor Joseph of Arimathea, and so quite a different Mary from the Mary of James. But (1) this reading has the very great preponderance of evidence opposed to it; (2) it is easily explained whence it originated, namely, out of the correct reading of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-55.htm" title="Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?">Matthew 13:55</a> (<span class="greekheb">Ἰωσήφ</span>, see in loc.), from which place the name of Joseph found its way into many of the witnesses (including Vulg. and codd. It.), not only at <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-3.htm" title="Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us?

Vulg. It. Aug.) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-47.htm" title="And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.">Mark 15:47</a>; while the underlying motive for conforming the name of Joses to that of Joseph the brother of Jesus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-55.htm" title="Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?">Matthew 13:55</a>, might be found as well in the assumption of the identity of the brethren of Jesus with the sons of Alphaeus, as in the error, which likewise was already ancient (see Theophylact), that the mother of Jesus is meant and is designated as the stepmother of James and Joses. (3) A Mary of Joseph is never named among the women of the Gospel history. But (4) if Joseph had been the counsellor just previously mentioned, Mark would have written not merely M. <span class="greekheb">ἡ Ἰωσήφ</span>, but M. <span class="greekheb">ἡ τοῦ Ἰωσήφ</span>., and would, moreover, assuming only some accuracy on his part, have indicated the relation of kinship, which he has not omitted even at <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-40.htm" title="There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;">Mark 15:40</a>, where, withal, the relation of Mary to James and Joses was well enough known. Finally, (5) the association of Mary of Magdala in the passage before us of itself entitles us to suppose that Mary would also have been one of the women who followed Jesus from Galilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-41.htm" title="(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him;) and many other women which came up with him to Jerusalem.">Mark 15:41</a>), as indeed at <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-1.htm" title="And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.">Mark 16:1</a> these two friends are again named. On the whole we must abide by the Maria Josis at the passage before us. Mark, in the passage where he mentions her for the first time, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-40.htm" title="There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;">Mark 15:40</a>, names her completely according to her two sons (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-56.htm" title="Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.">Matthew 27:56</a>), and then—because she was wont to be designated both as Maria Jacobi (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-10.htm" title="It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things to the apostles.">Luke 24:10</a>) and as Maria Josis—at <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/15.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/15-42.htm" title="And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,...">Mark 15:42-47</a>. <span class="ital">Burial</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/27-57.htm" title="When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:...">Matthew 27:57-66</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/23-50.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counselor; and he was a good man, and a just:...">Luke 23:50-56</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/mark/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">42–47</span> The Burial<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">42</span>. <span class="ital">the preparation</span>] i. e. for the Sabbath, which St Mark, writing for other readers than Jews, explains as “<span class="ital">the day before the Sabbath</span>.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/15.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-42.htm" title="And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,">Mark 15:42</a>. <span class="greekheb">Προσάββατον</span>, <span class="ital">the day before the Sabbath</span>) When there was the beginning made of resting.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when even was now</span> <span class="cmt_word">come.</span> The sabbath commenced on the Friday evening at six o'clock.
