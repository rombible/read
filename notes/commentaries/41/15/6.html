See Whitby, and note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/27-15.htm" title="Now at that feast the governor was wont to release to the people a prisoner, whom they would....">Matthew 27:15-18</a>. <span class="ital">There was one named Barabbas, bound with them that had made insurrection </span>— A crime which the Roman governors, and Pilate in particular, were more especially concerned and careful to punish; <span class="ital">who had committed murder in the insurrection </span>— He seems to have been the head of the rebels. <span class="ital">The multitude, crying aloud, </span>&c. — Greek, <span class="greekheb">αναβοησας ο οχλος ηρξατο αιτεισθαι</span>, <span class="ital">With great clamour, the multitude demanded of Pilate what he used to grant them. </span>So Campbell. <span class="ital">But Pilate </span>answered, <span class="ital">Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? </span>— If Pilate made this proposal with a view to preserve the life of Jesus, it is hard to say which he discovers most, his want of justice, or of courage, or of common sense. While in a most mean and cowardly manner he sacrifices justice to popular clamour, he enrages those whom he seeks to appease, by unseasonably repeating that title, <span class="ital">The King of the Jews, </span>which he could not but know was highly offensive to them. <span class="ital">For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him </span>— To be put to death, not from a regard to justice, but merely <span class="ital">for envy </span>at his popularity and goodness; and that these things, and no crime of his, either real or suspected, had made them his enemies. Pilate ought, therefore, certainly rather to have lost his own life than to have delivered Jesus to their will. See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/27-24.htm" title="When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see you to it....">Matthew 27:24-25</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-14 They bound Christ. It is good for us often to remember the bonds of the Lord Jesus, as bound with him who was bound for us. By delivering up the King, they, in effect, delivered up the kingdom of God, which was, therefore, as by their own consent, taken from them, and given to another nation. Christ gave Pilate a direct answer, but would not answer the witnesses, because the things they alleged were known to be false, even Pilate himself was convinced they were so. Pilate thought that he might appeal from the priests to the people, and that they would deliver Jesus out of the priests' hands. But they were more and more urged by the priests, and cried, Crucify him! Crucify him! Let us judge of persons and things by their merits, and the standard of God's word, and not by common report. The thought that no one ever was so shamefully treated, as the only perfectly wise, holy, and excellent Person that ever appeared on earth, leads the serious mind to strong views of man's wickedness and enmity to God. Let us more and more abhor the evil dispositions which marked the conduct of these persecutors.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the principal events in this chapter explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27.htm">Matthew 27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 15<p>Mr 15:1-20.

It seems to have been a custom, the origin of which is unknown, to release to the people on the occasion of the Passover and other great Feasts any prisoner whom they might select. The custom may have been of Jewish origin, and had been continued by the Roman governors from motives of policy.

This was Herod Antipas, ruler of Galilee; and Pilate, apparently convinced of our Lord's innocence, hoped to escape the responsibility of condemning an innocent man, by handing him over to Herod; for Pilate had heard that our Lord was a Galilean. Moreover, he hoped to accomplish another good result, namely, to recover the favor of Herod, which was desirable on political grounds. The first intention failed; for Herod sent our Lord back to Pilate in mockery, "arraying him in gorgeous apparel" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span>). But the second succeeded: "Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-12.htm">Luke 23:12</a>). There was now, however, another resource. <span class="cmt_word">At the feast</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) - literally, <span class="accented">at feast-time <span class="cmt_word">-</span> he used to release unto them one prisoner,</span> <span class="cmt_word">whom they asked of him</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). In St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-39.htm">John 18:39</a>) we read that Pilate said, "Ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the Passover." </body></html>
