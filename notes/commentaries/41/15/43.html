Oh that we may by grace be planted in the likeness of it! Joseph of Arimathea was one who waited for the kingdom of God. Those who hope for a share in its privileges, must own Christ's cause, when it seems to be crushed. This man God raised up for his service. There was a special providence, that Pilate should be so strict in his inquiry, that there might be no pretence to say Jesus was alive. Pilate gave Joseph leave to take down the body, and do what he pleased with it. Some of the women beheld where Jesus was laid, that they might come after the sabbath to anoint the dead body, because they had not time to do it before. Special notice was taken of Christ's sepulchre, because he was to rise again. And he will not forsake those who trust in him, and call upon him. Death, deprived of its sting, will soon end the believer's sorrows, as it ended those of the Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Joseph, an honorable counselor - A distinguished man, who probably held a high office among the Jews, as one of their great council, or a Jewish senator. The word "honorable," here, is not a mere title of "office," but is given in reference to his personal character, as being a man of integrity and blameless life.<p>Waited for the kingdom of God - Waited for, or expected, the coming of the Messiah. But this expression means more than an "indefinite" expectation that the Messiah "would" come, for all the Jews expected that. It implies that he believed "Jesus" to be the Messiah, and that he had "waited" for Him to build up the kingdom of God; and this agrees with what John says <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-38.htm">John 19:38</a>, that he was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews. He had retained his "secret" belief, in the hope that Jesus would be proclaimed and treated as the Messiah, and then he probably proposed openly to acknowledge his attachment to him. But God called him to a public profession of attachment in a different manner, and gave this distinguished man grace to evince it. So men often delay a profession of attachment to Christ. They cherish a secret love, they indulge a hope in the mercy of God, but they conceal it for fear of man; whereas God requires that the attachment should be made known. "Whosoever is ashamed of me," said the Saviour, "and of my words, of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his Father and with the holy angels," <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-38.htm">Mark 8:38</a>. Those who love the Saviour have no right to hide their light under a bushel. As soon as they have evidence satisfactory to their own mind that they are Christians, or have a "prevalent" belief, after faithful examination, that they truly love God, and that they depend on the Lord Jesus for salvation, so soon are they bound to profess Christ before men. This is the command of God, and this is the way of peace. None have the prospect of "comfort" in religion who do not have respect to all of the commandments of God.<p>Went in boldly unto Pilate - God had raised up this distinguished counselor and secret disciple for a special and most important occasion. The disciples of Jesus had fled, and if they had not, they had no influence with Pilate. Unless there had been a special application to Pilate in behalf of Jesus, his body would have been buried "that night" in the same grave with the malefactors, for it was a law of the Jews that the body of an executed man should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath. At this critical juncture God called forward this secret disciple - this friend of Jesus, though unknown as such to the world - and gave him confidence. He dared to express sympathy for the Saviour; he went in boldly and begged the body of Jesus. It needed no small measure of courage to do this. Jesus had just been condemned, mocked, spit on, crucified - the death of a slave or of the most guilty wretch. To avow attachment for him now was proof of sincere affection; and the Holy Spirit has thought this worthy of special notice, and has set down this bold attachment of a senator for Jesus for our imitation.<p>Craved the body - Begged, or asked. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 15:38-47.

Probably the latter. The place is called in the LXX. “Armathaim,” and by Josephus “Armathia.” Joseph was a man of wealth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-57.htm" title="When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:">Matthew 27:57</a>), a member of the Sanhedrim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-50.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counselor; and he was a good man, and a just:">Luke 23:50</a>), and a secret disciple of Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-38.htm" title="And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, sought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave.

He casts away all fear. The Cross transfigures cowards into heroes. “It was no light matter Joseph had undertaken: for to take part in a burial, at any time, would defile him for seven days, and make everything unclean which he touched (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-11.htm" title="He that touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.">Numbers 19:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-13.htm" title="Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean?

Instead of shortening their agonies the Roman law left them to die a lingering death, and suffered their bodies to moulder under the action of sun and rain (comp. Cic. <span class="ital">Tusc. Quæst</span>. i. 43, “Theodori nihil interest humine <span class="ital">an sublime</span> putrescat”), or be devoured by wild beasts (comp. Hor. <span class="ital">Epist</span>. xvi. 48, “Non hominem occidi: <span class="ital">non pasces in cruce corvos</span>”). The more merciful Jewish Law, however, did not allow such barbarities, and the Roman rulers had made an express exception in their favour. In accordance, therefore, with the request of the Jewish authorities, the legs of the malefactors had been broken to put them out of their misery (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-31.htm" title="The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) sought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.">John 19:31</a>), but our Lord was found to be <span class="ital">dead already</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-33.htm" title="But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they broke not his legs:">John 19:33</a>), and the soldier had pierced His side with a spear, the point of which was a handbreadth in width, thus causing a wound which would of itself have been sufficient to cause death, whereupon there had issued forth blood and water (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-34.htm" title="But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and immediately came there out blood and water.">John 19:34</a>).

St. Jerome says that this city was called Ramathaim-Zophim (the lofty place), where dwelt Elkanah and Hannah of old, and where Samuel was born. Joseph was most probably a native of Arimathaea; but he was now a citizen and counsellor of Jerusalem. He was an honorable counsellor (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>), <span class="accented">a councillor of honorable estate</span> (Revised Version). St. Matthew says he was a rich man. It is evident that he regarded himself as a settled inhabitant of Jerusalem, since he had thus provided himself with a place of sepulture. <span class="cmt_word">He was waiting for</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">-</span> literally, <span class="accented">looking for - <span class="cmt_word"></span>the kingdom of God</span>. St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-57.htm">Matthew 27:57</a>) says that he was a disciple of Jesus.

St. Chrysostom says, "The courage of Joseph is greatly to be admired, in that, for the love of Christ, he exposed himself to the danger of death." The fact that he was "looking for the kingdom of God" explains his conduct. It shows that he believed in Christ, and through his grace hoped for everlasting salvation; and in this hope he thought little of shelving his reverence for Christ, and so" boldly went in unto Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/15.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Joseph of Arimathaea (&#x399;&#787;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c6; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x391;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., Joseph, he from Arimathaea: the article indicating a man well known.<p>Honorable (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>Compounded of &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;, well, and &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, form, shape, figure.
