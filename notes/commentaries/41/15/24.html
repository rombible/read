Whenever we look unto Christ crucified, we must remember what was written over his head; he is a King, and we must give up ourselves to be his subjects, as Israelites indeed. They crucified two thieves with him, and him in the midst; they thereby intended him great dishonour. But it was foretold that he should be numbered with the transgressors, because he was made sin for us. Even those who passed by railed at him. They told him to come down from the cross, and they would believe; but they did not believe, though he gave them a more convincing sign when he came up from the grave. With what earnestness will the man who firmly believes the truth, as made known by the sufferings of Christ, seek for salvation! With what gratitude will he receive the dawning hope of forgiveness and eternal life, as purchased for him by the sufferings and death of the Son of God! and with what godly sorrow will he mourn over the sins which crucified the Lord of glory!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wine mingled ... - Matthew says "vinegar."

From the mention of the title placed over the Saviour’s Head, it is probable that His cross was of the third kind, and that He was laid upon it either while it was on the ground, or lifted and fastened to it as it stood upright, His arms stretched out along the two cross-beams, and His body resting on a little projection, <span class="ital">sedile</span>, a foot or two above the earth.

The outer garment, or <span class="ital">tallîth</span>, they divided into fourth parts, probably loosening the seams. The inner garment, like the robes of the priests, <span class="ital">was without seam, woven from the top throughout</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-23.htm" title="Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.">John 19:23</a>), of linen or perhaps of wool.

Such is the most approved reading. The evangelist states the fact without staying to dwell on the painful circumstances connected with the act of nailing him to the cross; and passes on to the mention of other things. <span class="cmt_word">They part his garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take</span>. The outer robe and the tunic would have been removed previously to the crucifixion. St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-23.htm">John 21:23</a>) here goes into details. "They took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top through.. out." <span class="accented">His garments</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>). This would be the loose, flowing outer dress with girdle. The tunic (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>) was a closefitting dress, worn underneath the <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x2e;</span> There were four soldiers employed for each crucifixion. St. Cyril refers to the clothes of criminals as the perquisite of the executioners. Here was another ingredient of bitterness in our Lord's cup, that he saw before his eyes his garments torn by the soldiery, and his tunic divided to them by lot. But he divested himself of these garments of mortality, that he might clothe us with life and immortality. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/15.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>What each should take (&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#837;)<p>Lit., who should take what.
