Even at this day, in every believer, faith has a latent miraculous power: (every effect of prayer being really miraculous:) although in many, because of their littleness of faith, and because the world is unworthy, that power is not exerted. Miracles in the beginning were helps to faith; now also they are the objects of it. At Leonberg, a town in Wirtemberg, in the memory of our fathers, a cripple, that could hardly move with crutches, while the dean was preaching on this very text, was in a moment made whole.” See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-22.htm" title="And Jesus answering said to them, Have faith in God.">Mark 11:22</a>; where many similar instances are referred to; the number of which might easily be increased on the most certain evidence. <span class="ital">Shall follow them that believe </span>— The gospel word, and faith therein, must precede, and then the signs shall follow. <span class="ital">In my name they shall cast out devils, &c. — </span>That is, by my authority committed to them, and by my power attending them. Raising the dead is not mentioned here; so our Lord performed even more than he promised. <span class="ital">If they drink any deadly thing </span>— But not by their own choice: God never calls us to try any such experiment; <span class="ital">it shall not hurt them.

Our blessed Lord renewed his choice of the eleven as his apostles, and commissioned them to go into all the world, to preach his gospel to every creature. Only he that is a true Christian shall be saved through Christ. Simon Magus professed to believe, and was baptized, yet he was declared to be in the bonds of iniquity: see his history in Ac 8:13-25. Doubtless this is a solemn declaration of that true faith which receives Christ in all his characters and offices, and for all the purposes of salvation, and which produces its right effect on the heart and life; not a mere assent, which is a dead faith, and cannot profit. The commission of Christ's ministers extends to every creature throughout the world, and the declarations of the gospel contain not only truths, encouragements, and precepts, but also most awful warnings. Observe what power the apostles should be endued with, for confirming the doctrine they were to preach. These were miracles to confirm the truth of the gospel, and means of spreading the gospel among nations that had not heard it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And these signs - These miracles. These evidences that they are sent from God.<p>Them that believe - The apostles, and those in the primitive age who were endowed with like power. This promise was fulfilled if it can be shown that these signs followed in the case of any who believed, and it is not necessary to suppose that they would follow in the case of all. The meaning is, that they would be the result of faith, or of the belief of the gospel. It is true that they were. These signs were shown in the case of the apostles and early Christians. The infidel cannot say that the promise has not been fulfilled unless he can show that this never occurred; the Christian should be satisfied that the promise was fulfilled if these miracles were ever actually wrought, though they do not occur now; and the believer now should not expect a miracle in his case. Miracles were necessary for the establishment of religion in the world; they are not necessary for its continuance now.<p>In my name - By my authority, and using the power that I would in such cases, if bodily present. This was done; and in this they differed essentially from the manner in which Jesus himself wrought miracles. He did it in "his own name," and as possessing original, underived authority. See the account of his stilling the sea (<a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-26.htm">Matthew 8:26</a>, etc.); of his healing the sick <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-5.htm">Matthew 9:5-6</a>; of his raising Lazarus, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11.htm">John 11</a>. The prophets spoke "in the name of the Lord." The apostles did likewise, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6</a>, etc. There was, therefore, an important difference between Jesus and all the other messengers that God has sent into the world. He acted in his own name; they in the name of another. He wielded his own power; they were the instruments by which God put forth the omnipotence of his arm to save. He was therefore God; they were men of like passions as other men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-15.htm">Acts 14:15</a>.<p>Shall they cast out devils - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>.

And such is the speaking in <span class="ital">new</span> languages mentioned in the passage before us, in such languages, that is, as they could not previously speak, which were new and strange <span class="ital">to the speakers</span>. Hereby the writer betrays that he is writing in the <span class="ital">sub-apostolic</span> period, since he, like Luke in reference to the Pentecostal miracle, imports into the first age of the church a conception of the <span class="ital">glossolalia</span> intensified by legend; nay, he makes the phenomenon thereby conceived as a speaking in strange languages to be even a common possession of believers, while Luke limits it solely to the unique event of Pentecost. We must accordingly understand the <span class="greekheb">γλώσσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λαλεῖν καιναῖς</span> of our text, not in the sense of the speaking <span class="ital">with tongues</span>, 1 Corinthians 12-14, but in the sense of the much more wonderful speaking <span class="ital">of languages</span>, Acts 2, as it certainly is in keeping with the two strange particulars that immediately follow. Hence every rationalizing attempt to explain away the concrete designation derived, without any doubt as to the meaning of the author, from the Acts of the Apostles, is here as erroneous as it is in the case of Acts 2, whether recourse be had to generalities, such as the newness of the utterance of the Christian spirit (Hilgenfeld), or the new formation of the spirit-world by the new word of the Spirit (Lange), the ecstatic speaking on religious subjects (Bleek), or others.

Casting out devils represents the evangelic miracles; speaking with tongues those of the apostolic age; taking up venomous serpents and drinking deadly poison seem to introduce us into the twilight of apocryphal story.

Signs were in the beginning the props and stays of faith: now they are also the object of faith. At Leonberg, a town of Wirtemberg [A.C. 1644, thirteenth Sunday after Trinity], a girl of twenty years of age was so disabled in her limbs, as hardly to be able to creep along by the help of crutches; but whilst the Dean [Raumeier was his name] was, from the pulpit, dwelling on the miraculous power of Jesus’ name, she suddenly was raised up and restored to the use of her limbs.[12]—<span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span>, <span class="ital">these</span>) Miracles are here alluded to of a most palpable kind, and such as are altogether removed from every suspicion of trickery.—<span class="greekheb">παρακολουθήσει</span>, <span class="ital">shall follow in the train of</span>) The word and faith precede the signs, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-20.htm" title="And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following.

At Lavingen, in the year 1606, Nov. 26, Joseph Jenisch was born of the noble stock of the Kellers; he was destitute of a tongue from his birth, but in consequence of the earnest prayers of his parents and family, when he had not yet finished his first year, he was able to name distinctly the several members of the family, and was, therefore, dedicated to the service of the ministry, which for forty years he discharged at Böblingen and Münchingen: he died on the 10th of April 1675.—ED. and TRANSL.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17, 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And these signs shall follow them that believe</span>. Such evidences were necessary in the first dawn of Christianity, to attract attention to the doctrine; but our Lord's words do not mean that they were to be in perpetuity, as a continually recurring evidence of the truth of Christianity. St. Gregory (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>) says, "These signs were necessary in the beginning of Christianity. In order that faith might take root and increase, it must be nourished by miracle; for so even we, when we plant shrubs, only water them until we see that they are taking root, and when we see that they have rooted themselves, we cease to water them. And this is what St. Paul means where he says 'Tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>)." <span class="cmt_word">In my name shall they cast out devils</span>. St. Mark, of all the evangelists, dwells most perhaps on this, as characteristic of our Lord's work, and as the evidence of his supreme dominion over the spiritual world<span class="cmt_word">. They shall speak with new tongues</span>. This was the first intimation of the great miracle to be inaugurated on the day of Pentecost. The gift was continued but for a very limited time. <span class="cmt_word">They shall take up serpents.</span> The instance of St. Paul at Melita (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-3.htm">Acts 28:3-5</a>) would be familiar to St. Mark's readers. <span class="cmt_word">And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt them</span>. There are some few traditionary notices of the fulfillment of this promise; as in the case of "Justus Barsabas," mentioned by Eusebius ('H.E.,' 3, 19), and of St. John, mentioned by St. Augustine. It may be observed of this passage, that no one could have interpolated it after the cessation of the signs to which it refers, which took place very early. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/16.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Shall follow (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>The preposition &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;, alongside of, gives the sense of accompany. </body></html>
