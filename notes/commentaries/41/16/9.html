The history of the verses that follow is in every way remarkable. They are not found in two of the oldest MSS.—the Sinaitic and the Vatican—are marked as doubtful in many others, and are wanting in some versions. In some of these (<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in the Vatican MS.) there is a blank space left between <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-8.htm" title="And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulcher; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.">Mark 16:8</a> and the beginning of St. Luke, as though the writer had suspended his work and waited for materials. The absence was noticed by Jerome, who says that “nearly all the Greek texts omit them.” Eusebius states the same fact as true of “the correct MSS.;” and no reference is made to them in the tables of parallel passages which were constructed for reference by Eusebius and Ammonius. On the other hand, they are referred to by Irenæus (about A.D. 170), and are found in the Alexandrian and Cambridge MSS., and in twelve other uncials which are nearly (some say, quite) as old as the two which omit them. When we turn to the internal evidence we find that the narrative, which up to this point had followed closely in the footsteps of St. Matthew, now becomes a very condensed epitome of St. John’s record of our Lord’s appearance to Mary Magdalene (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/20-11.htm" title="And when they had received it, they murmured against the manager of the house,">Matthew 20:11-18</a>), of St. Luke’s account of the journey to Emmaus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/24-13.htm" title="And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about three score furlongs.">Luke 24:13-35</a>), of the appearance to the ten disciples in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/20-19.htm" title="Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.">John 20:19-25</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/24-36.htm" title="And as they thus spoke, Jesus himself stood in the middle of them, and said to them, Peace be to you.">Luke 24:36-43</a>, of the mission of the eleven reported in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/28-16.htm" title="Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.">Matthew 28:16-20</a>, of the Ascension as given by <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/24-50.htm" title="And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.">Luke 24:50-53</a>. Two explanations of these facts are possible. (1) We may suppose that the writer of the Gospel wrote two copies of it, leaving one unfinished, ending at <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-8.htm" title="And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulcher; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.">Mark 16:8</a>; that this passed into the hands of persons by whom it was copied as complete, and so became the archetype of the MSS. in which the verses are wanting; while those that contain the subsequent verses were made from a more perfect text, written by St. Mark himself. (2) That the Gospel, having been originally completed by the writer, was in some way, by accident or design, mutilated; that as such it was reproduced faithfully by some transcribers, while others thought it better to give it a completion of some kind, by condensing what they found in the other Gospels. Of the two hypotheses the latter seems the more probable. It seems better, looking to these facts, to reserve notes, for the most part, for the Gospels in which the narratives appear in what was probably their original and certainly their fuller form.<p>(9-11) <span class= "bld">First to Mary Magdalene.</span>—See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/20-11.htm" title="But Mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulcher,">John 20:11-18</a>, but note that St. Mark’s account of her as one from whom Jesus “had cast out seven devils” is not from St. John, but from <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-2.htm" title="And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,">Luke 8:2</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/mark/16.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Mark<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>THE INCREDULOUS DISCIPLES<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">‘FIRST TO MARY’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-9.htm" title="Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.">Mark 16:9</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> A great pile of legend has been built on the one or two notices of Mary Magdalene in Scripture. Art, poetry, and philanthropy have accepted and inculcated these, till we almost feel as if they were bits of the Bible. But there is not the shadow of a foundation for them. She has generally been identified with the woman in Luke’s Gospel ‘who was a sinner.’ There is no reason at all for that identification. On the contrary, there is a reason against it, in the fact that immediately after that narrative she is named as one of the little band of women who ministered to Jesus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Here is all that we know of her: that Christ cast out the seven devils; that she became one of the Galilean women, including the mothers of Jesus and of John, who ‘ministered to Him of their substance’; that she was one of the Marys at the Cross and saw the interment; that she came to the sepulchre, heard the angel’s message, went to John with it, came back and stood without at the sepulchre, saw the Lord, and, having heard His voice and clasped His feet, returned to the little company, and then she drops out of the narrative and is no more named. That is all. It is enough. There are large lessons in this fact which Mark {or whoever wrote this chapter} gives with such emphasis, ‘He appeared first to Mary Magdalene.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Think what the Resurrection is-how stupendous and wonderful! Who might have been expected to be its witnesses? But see! the first eye that beholds is this poor sin-stained woman’s. What a distance between the two extremes of her experience-devil-ridden and gazing on the Risen Saviour!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. An example of the depth to which the soul of man can descend.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>This fact of possession is very obscure and strange. I doubt whether we can understand it. But I cannot see how we can bring it down to the level of mere disease without involving Jesus Christ in the charge of consciously aiding in upholding what, if it be not an awful truth, is one of the grimmest, ghastliest superstitions that ever terrified men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> In all ways He gives in His adhesion to the fact of demoniacal possession. He speaks to the demons, and of them, rebukes them, holds conversations with them, charges them to be silent. He distinguishes between possession and diseases. ‘Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead’-these commands bring together forms of sickness running its course; why should He separate from them His next command and endowment, ‘cast out devils,’ unless because He regarded demoniacal possession as separate from sickness in any form? He sees in His casting of them out the triumph over the personal power of evil. ‘I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.’ But while the fact seems to be established, the thing is only known to us by its signs. These were madness, melancholy, sometimes dumbness, sometimes fits and convulsions; the man was dominated by an alien power; there was a strange, awful double consciousness; ‘We are many,’ ‘My name is Legion.’ There was absolute control by this alien power, which like some parasitical worm had rooted itself within the poor wretch, and there lived upon his blood and life juices-only that it lived in the spirit, dominated the will, and controlled the nature.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Probably there had always been the yielding to the impulse to sin of some sort, or at any rate the man had opened the door for the devil to come in.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> This woman had been in the deepest depths of this awful abyss. ‘Seven’ is the numerical symbol of completeness, so she had been utterly devil-ridden. And she had once been a little child in some Galilean home, and parents had seen her budding beauty and early, gentle, womanly ways. And now, think of the havoc! the distorted face, the foul words, the blasphemous thoughts! And is this worse than our sinful case? Are not the devils that possess us as real and powerful?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. An example of the cleansing power of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>We know nothing about how she had come under His merciful eye, nor any of the circumstances of her healing, but only that this woman, with whom the serpent was so closely intertwined, as in some pictures of Eve’s temptation, was not beyond His reach, and was set free. Note- There is no condition of human misery which Christ cannot alleviate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> None is so sunk in sin that He cannot redeem them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> For all in the world there is hope.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Look on the extremest forms of sin. We can regard them all with the assurance that Christ can cleanse them-prostitutes, thieves, respectable worldlings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> None is so bad as to have lost His love.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> None is so bad as to be excluded from the purpose of His death.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> None is so bad as to be beyond the reach of His cleansing power.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> None has wandered so far that he cannot come back.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Think of the earliest believers-a thief, a ‘woman that was a sinner,’ this Mary, a Zacchæus, a persecuting Paul, a rude, rough jailer, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Remember Paul’s description of a class of the Corinthian saints-’such were some of you.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> As long as man is man, so long is God ready to receive him back. There is no place where sun does not shine. No heart is given over to irremediable hardness. None ever comes to Christ in vain.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The Saviour is greater than all our sins.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The deliverance is more than sufficient for the worst.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Ezekiel’s vision of dry bones.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. An example of how the remembrance of past and pardoned sin may be a blessing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Mary evidently tried always to be beside Him. The cure had been perfect, but perhaps there was a tremulous fear, as in the man that prayed ‘that he might be with Him.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And so, look how all the notices give us one picture of a heart set on Him. There were- {a} Consciousness of weakness, that made her long for His presence as a security.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {b} Deep love, that made her long for His presence as a joy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {c} Thankful gratitude, that made her long for opportunities to serve Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And this is what the remembrance of Jesus should be to us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">IV. An example of how the most degraded may rise highest in fellowship with Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘First’ to her, because she needed Him and longed for Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now this is but an illustration of the great principle that by God’s mercy sin when it is hated and pardoned may be made to subserve our highest joys.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It is not sin which separates us from God, but it is unpardoned sin. Not that the more we sin the more we are fit for Him, for all sin is loss. There are ways in which even forgiven and repented sin may injure a man. But there is nothing in it to hinder our coming close to the Saviour and enjoying all the fulness of His love, so that if we use it rightly it may become a help.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> If it leads us to that clinging of which we have just spoken, then we shall come nearer to God for it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The divine presence is always given to those who long for it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Sin may help to kindle such longings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> He who has been almost dead in the wilderness will keep near the guide. The man that has been starved with cold in Arctic night will prize the glory and grace of sunshine in fairer lands.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Instances in Church history-Paul, Augustine, Bunyan.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘Publicans and harlots go into the kingdom before you.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The noblest illustration is in heaven, where men lead the song of Redemption.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> God uses sin as a black background on which the brightest rainbow tints of His mercy are displayed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> You can come to this Saviour whatever you have been. I say to no man, ‘Sin, for it does not matter.’ But I do say, ‘If you are conscious of sin, deep, dark, damning, that makes no barrier between you and God. You may come all the nearer for it if you will let your past teach you to long for His love and to lean on Him.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘He appeared first to Mary Magdalene,’ and those who stand nearest the throne and lead the anthems of heaven, and look up with undazzled angels’ faces to the God of their joy, whose name blazes on their foreheads, all these were guilty, sinful men. But they ‘have washed their robes and made them white.’ There will be in heaven some of the worst sinners that ever lived on earth. There will not be one out of whom He has not ‘cast seven devils.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/mark/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/16-9.htm" title="Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils....">Mark 16:9-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">When Jesus was risen early, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene </span>— “There is something very remarkable in this passage of the history. None of the apostles, or male disciples, were honoured with the first visions of the angels, or with the immediate news of Christ’s resurrection, far less with the first appearances of Jesus himself. The angels in the sepulchre kept themselves invisible all the time Peter and John were there. Perhaps the male disciples in general had this mark of disrespect put on them, both because they had with inexcusable and shameful cowardice forsaken their Master when he fell into the hands of his enemies, and because their faith was so weak, that they had absolutely despaired of his being the Messiah when they saw him expire on the cross, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-21.htm" title="But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.">Luke 24:21</a>. How different was the conduct of the women! Laying aside the weakness and timidity natural to their sex, they showed an uncommon magnanimity in the whole of this melancholy transaction. Hence, in preference to the male disciples, they were honoured with the news of Christ’s resurrection, and had their eyes gladdened with the first sight of their beloved Lord after he arose, so that they preached the joyful tidings of his resurrection to the apostles themselves.” <span class="ital">And she went </span>— With the other women; <span class="ital">and told them that had been with him </span>— That is, the disciples that had constantly attended him; <span class="ital">as they mourned and wept </span>— For the loss of their dear Master. <span class="ital">And they believed not </span>— Such were the prevailing prejudices that had taken possession of their minds, and so entirely were their spirits dejected and their hopes blasted by his death, that, though they could not think this was related with a design to impose upon them, yet they were ready to impute it to the power of imagination, and supposed that the women who gave them the information were deceived.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:9-13 Better news cannot be brought to disciples in tears, than to tell them of Christ's resurrection. And we should study to comfort disciples that are mourners, by telling them whatever we have seen of Christ. It was a wise providence that the proofs of Christ's resurrection were given gradually, and admitted cautiously, that the assurance with which the apostles preached this doctrine afterwards might the more satisfy. Yet how slowly do we admit the consolations which the word of God holds forth! Therefore while Christ comforts his people, he often sees it needful to rebuke and correct them for hardness of heart in distrusting his promise, as well as in not obeying his holy precepts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Tell his disciples and Peter - It is remarkable that Peter is singled out for special notice.

Though the word "Jesus" is not in the text, it is rightly supplied; for of the rising of no other, can the words be understood; and so the Persic version supplies "Messiah", or "Christ"; that Jesus rose from the dead on the first day of the week, agrees with the accounts of all the evangelists, and is here expressly affirmed; the phrase, "the first day of the week", is so indeed placed, as that it may be thought to connected with the following words; as it is by some; fancying there would otherwise be a disagreement with <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-1.htm">Matthew 28:1</a>, whereas there is none; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-1.htm">Matthew 28:1</a> though it is true also, that he did appear on that day to Mary Magdalene, it being the same day he rose from the dead. But the true reading and pointing are as here placed; and the phrase belongs to, and points out the day of Christ's rising from the dead; and which ambiguity is removed in the Syriac version, which renders it, "now early on the first day of the week he rose"; and so the Persic version, "the Messiah", or "Christ, therefore on the morning of the, first day, rose from the dead": and that he rose early on that day, is clear from the women, who set out at the end of the sabbath, when that was past and over; and got to the sepulchre by the time the day dawned; and one of them, while it was dark, and all of them by break of day, at least by sunrising, and he was then risen: <p>he appeared first to Mary Magdalene; in the habit of a gardener, for whom she took him at first; and this was at the sepulchre, where she staid after the disciples were gone. That she was the very first person that Christ showed himself to, after his resurrection, may be concluded from hence, and from the account the Evangelist John has given, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-14.htm">John 20:14</a>, nor is there any reason to think, that before this, he appeared to his mother, of which the evangelists are entirely silent. This was a very great favour, and an high honour that was bestowed upon her; and who had received large favours from him before: <p>out of whom he had cast seven devils, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-2.htm">Luke 8:2</a>. And if she had been a very wicked person, as she is commonly thought to be, and very likely she had been, since Satan had such a power over her, as to lodge seven devils in her, it is an instance of abounding grace, that Christ should heap up favours on such an one; and she should be the first that he should appear to and converse with after his resurrection. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{1}</span> Now when <i>Jesus</i> was risen early the first <i>day</i> of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</span><p>(1) Christ himself appears to Mary Magdalene to reprove the disciple's incredulity.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/mark/16.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/16-9.htm" title="Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils....">Mark 16:9-10</a>.

The holy women had seen the stone rolled away, and the empty tomb, and had heard the words of the Angels, and announced all that had occurred to the Eleven, but their words appeared to them as “<span class="ital">idle tales</span>” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-11.htm" title="And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.">Luke 24:11</a>). The Apostles Peter and John also, when they visited the Sepulchre, beheld proofs that it was indeed empty, but “<span class="ital">Him they saw not</span>.” The first person to whom the Saviour shewed Himself after His resurrection was Mary of Magdala. After recounting to the Apostles Peter and John the rolling away of the stone, she seems to have returned to the sepulchre; there she beheld the two angels in white apparel, whom the other women had seen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-12.htm" title="And sees two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.">John 20:12</a>), and while she was in vain solacing her anguish at the removal of her Lord, He stood before her, and one word sufficed to assure her that it was He, her Healer, and her Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">out of whom he had cast seven devils</span>] That He should have been pleased to manifest Himself first after His resurrection not to the whole Apostolic company, but to a woman, and that woman not His earthly Mother, but Mary of Magdala, clearly made a strong impression on the early Church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/16.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-9.htm" title="Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.">Mark 16:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πρωῒ</span>, <span class="ital">early in the morning</span>) Construe with <span class="greekheb">ἐφάνη</span>, <span class="ital">He appeared</span>.

St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-2.htm">Luke 8:2</a>) mentions that "seven devils had gone out of her;" and St. Mark repeats it here, to show the power of love and penitence, that she was the first to be permitted to see the risen Savior. The vision of the angel had scared her, and she said nothing; but the actual sight of her risen Lord gave her confidence, and she went immediately, in obedience to his command, and told the disciples (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-11.htm">John 20:11-18</a>).
