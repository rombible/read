A glimpse of that kingdom was given in the transfiguration of Christ. It is good to be away from the world, and alone with Christ: and how good to be with Christ glorified in heaven with all the saints! But when it is well with us, we are apt not to care for others, and in the fulness of our enjoyments, we forget the many wants of our brethren. God owns Jesus, and accepts him as his beloved Son, and is ready to accept us in him. Therefore we must own and accept him as our beloved Saviour, and must give up ourselves to be ruled by him. Christ does not leave the soul, when joys and comforts leave it. Jesus explained to the disciples the prophecy about Elias. This was very suitable to the ill usage of John Baptist.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Why say the scribes ... - See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-10.htm">Matthew 17:10-13</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 9<p>Mr 9:1-13.

Christ had been telling his disciples that he should suffer.

Only this hindered the certainty of their persuasion that Christ was he, because Elias was not yet come, whom they did expect, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-5.htm" title="Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:">Malachi 4:5</a></span>; for they expected the coming of Elias in person, whereas the prophecy was to be understood of one <span class="ital">in the spirit and power of Elias, </span> as the angel expounded it, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-17.htm" title="And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.">Luke 1:17</a></span>. They also expected that Elias, when he came, should make a great change in their world, and bring all things again into order; but still their eye was upon a secular change, and a restoring of them to that liberty of their country which they formerly enjoyed, whereas the prophecy, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-6.htm" title="And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.">Malachi 4:6</a></span>, is expounded by the angel, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-16.htm" title="And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.">Luke 1:16</a>,17</span>, <span class="ital">And many of the</span> <span class="ital">children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.</span> —<span class="ital">to</span> <span class="ital">turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children, and the</span> <span class="ital">disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people</span> <span class="ital">prepared for the Lord.</span> The disciples, being Jews, were under the prejudices of these notions about Elias, so commonly received by the doctors of their church and the generality of their people. To this our Saviour answers, The thing was true, Elias (that is, one <span class="ital">in</span> <span class="ital">the spirit and power of Elias)</span> was, according to the prophecy of Malachi, to come before the Messias; but they had overlooked him, for indeed this Elias was come, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-14.htm" title="And if you will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.">Matthew 11:14</a></span>, and by his preaching the doctrine of repentance for the remission of sins had endeavoured to restore all things, that is, to make a great change in the hearts and lives of the Jews, but they had put him to death. He further telleth them, that John had told them of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought. He did indeed tell them so, when he pointed to him passing by, and said, <span class="ital">Behold the Lamb of God, which</span> <span class="ital">taketh away</span> (or taketh up or beareth) <span class="ital">the sins of the world, </span> <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29</a></span>. So that this was no just prejudice to their believing that he was the true Messiah. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they asked him, saying,....

The Pharisees and Scribes may have urged as a capital objection against the Messiah-ship of their Master that no Elias went before Him. “It would be an infinite task,” says Lightfoot, “to produce all the passages out of the Jewish writings which one might concerning the expected coming of Elias.” He was to restore to the Jews the pot of manna and the rod of Aaron, to cry to the mountains, “Peace and blessing come into the world, peace and blessing come into the world!” “Salvation cometh, Salvation cometh, to gather all the scattered sons of Jacob, and restore all things to Israel as in ancient times.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-11.htm" title="And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?">Mark 9:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὅτι λέγουσιν</span>, <span class="ital">they say</span>) An interrogation by implication.[3] [<span class="greekheb">τρῶτον</span>, <span class="ital">first</span>) before that the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come, <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-5.htm" title="Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:">Malachi 4:5</a>.
