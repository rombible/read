What had been written of or for the one, the record of bold rebuke and consequent suffering for the Truth, had received its fulfilment in the other.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-13 Here is a prediction of the near approach Christ's kingdom. A glimpse of that kingdom was given in the transfiguration of Christ. It is good to be away from the world, and alone with Christ: and how good to be with Christ glorified in heaven with all the saints! But when it is well with us, we are apt not to care for others, and in the fulness of our enjoyments, we forget the many wants of our brethren. God owns Jesus, and accepts him as his beloved Son, and is ready to accept us in him. Therefore we must own and accept him as our beloved Saviour, and must give up ourselves to be ruled by him. Christ does not leave the soul, when joys and comforts leave it. Jesus explained to the disciples the prophecy about Elias. This was very suitable to the ill usage of John Baptist.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Why say the scribes ... - See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-10.htm">Matthew 17:10-13</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 9<p>Mr 9:1-13.

A few remarks here will not be out of place (i) <span class="ital">On the three accounts of the Transfiguration; </span>(ii)<span class="ital"> On the meaning and significance of the event itself</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(i)&emsp;&emsp;<span class="ital">The three accounts</span>. (<span class="ital">a</span>) All three Evangelists relate the conversation which preceded, and the Miracle which succeeded it. (<span class="ital">b</span>) St Matthew alone records the prostration of the disciples through excessive fear, and the Lord’s strengthening touch and cheering words uttered once before on the stormy lake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/17-6.htm" title="And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid....">Matthew 17:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-27.htm" title="But straightway Jesus spoke to them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.">Matthew 14:27</a>), recalling, as the Hebrew Evangelist, the scene in the Exodus when the face of Moses shone, and the children of Israel <span class="ital">were afraid to come nigh him</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/34-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him....">Exodus 34:29-30</a>). (<span class="ital">c</span>) St Mark, in describing the effect of the Transfiguration, uses the strongest material imagery, “white as <span class="ital">snow</span>,” “so as <span class="ital">no fuller on earth can whiten</span>,” and he alone has the sudden vanishing of the heavenly visitors, and the inquiring look around of the disciples, and their questioning amongst themselves what “<span class="ital">the rising from the dead could mean</span>.” (<span class="ital">d</span>) St Luke alone tells us that our Lord was engaged in prayer at the moment of His glorification (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-29.htm" title="And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.">Luke 9:29</a>), and mentions the slumbrous and wakeful condition of the three witnesses, the subject of mysterious converse between the Lord and His visitors from the other world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-31.htm" title="Who appeared in glory, and spoke of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.">Luke 9:31</a>), and the fact that the Heavenly Voice <span class="ital">succeeded their departure</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-35.htm" title="And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.">Luke 9:35</a>). (<span class="ital">e</span>) Both St Matthew and St Mark place in immediate connection with the Event the remarkable conversation about Elias, but St Matthew alone applies the Lord’s words concerning that great prophet to John the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-13.htm" title="Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptist.">Matthew 17:13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(ii) <span class="ital">The meaning and significance of the Event</span>. This we may believe had respect (<span class="ital">a</span>) to the Apostles, and (<span class="ital">b</span>) to our Lord Himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">a</span>) <span class="ital">As regards the Apostles</span>. This one full manifestation of His Divine glory, during the period of the Incarnation, was designed to confirm their faith, to comfort them in prospect of their Master’s approaching sufferings, to prepare them to see in His Passion the fulfilment alike of the Law and the Prophets, to give them a glimpse of the celestial Majesty of Him, whom they had given up all to follow.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) <span class="ital">As regards our Lord</span>. As regards the Redeemer we may conclude that the transaction marked His consecration as the Divine Victim, Who was to accomplish the great “Decease” at Jerusalem, even as the Baptism inaugurated the commencement of His public ministry; it was the solemn attestation of His perfect oneness with His Father in heaven at the very time when He was about to descend into the valley of the shadow of death. It was, as it has well been called, “the summit-level” of the Life Incarnate. From this time forward there is a perceptible change. (<span class="ital">a</span>) <span class="ital">Miracles</span>, which hitherto had abounded in prodigal profusion, well-nigh cease. Only five mark the period between the Transfiguration and the Passion. Those, for whom “signs” could avail, were already won. For the rest, no more could be done. They were like those, amongst whom in His earlier ministry, “He could do no mighty work because of their unbelief.” (<span class="ital">b</span>) As regards His <span class="ital">teaching</span>, public addresses, before the rule, now become few and rare; His special revelations of the future to the chosen Twelve become more frequent, and they uniformly circle, unenshrouded in type or figure or dark saying, round the Cross.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-13.htm" title="But I say to you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done to him whatever they listed, as it is written of him.">Mark 9:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὅτι καὶ</span>) <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span>, <span class="ital">even</span>.—<span class="greekheb">αὐτῷ</span>, <span class="ital">to him</span>) to Elias.
