Had he been delivered into the hands of devils, and they had done this, it had not been so strange; but that men should thus shamefully treat the Son of man, who came to redeem and save them, is wonderful. Still observe that when Christ spake of his death, he always spake of his resurrection, which took the reproach of it from himself, and should have taken the grief of it from his disciples. Many remain ignorant because they are ashamed to inquire. Alas! that while the Saviour teaches so plainly the things which belong to his love and grace, men are so blinded that they understand not his sayings. We shall be called to account about our discourses, and to account for our disputes, especially about being greater than others. Those who are most humble and self-denying, most resemble Christ, and shall be most tenderly owned by him. This Jesus taught them by a sign; whoever shall receive one like this child, receives me. Many have been like the disciples, ready to silence men who have success in preaching to sinners repentance in Christ's name, because they follow not with them. Our Lord blamed the apostles, reminding them that he who wrought miracles in his name would not be likely to hurt his cause. If sinners are brought to repent, to believe in the Saviour, and to live sober, righteous, and godly lives, we then see that the Lord works by the preacher.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-1.htm">Matthew 18:1-5</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35. If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all&#8212;that is, "let him be" such: he must be prepared to take the last and lowest place. See on [1464]Mr 10:42-45.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/mark/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 35-37. Matthew’s recital of this passage expounds Mark; he saith Christ said, <span class="ital">Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of God. And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.</span> Luke also relates this passage something more shortly, but without any contradiction to what is said by the other evangelists. The sense is plain: our Saviour’s design was to check the ambition and ignorance of his disciples, never more unseasonably showed than now, when a suffering time was so hard at hand. He at first did it by word of mouth, telling them, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">If any man desire to be first, he shall be last of all, </span> the least valuable in the eyes of God, and he would have them value such a person least. Humility is that which most exalts a soul in the eyes of Christ, and setteth it highest in his esteem. But it is observable our Lord doth not say, he that is the first, but he who desireth to be first. God is a God of order, not of confusion; there can be no order without a first as well as a last. But Christians (ministers especially, for he is here speaking to the twelve) ought to be sought out for, not to seek places of preeminence and dignity: he that is first in seeking them, is usually last as to any true worth deserving them, and ought last to obtain them. Then he teacheth them humility by the type of a little child, which he setteth in the midst of them, telling them they must be like that little child, (saith Matthew,) not in all things, but in the want of ambition, in a carelessness as to the great things of this life. And whosoever entertained or showed kindness to such a one, Christ would take it as done to himself; and what kindness was showed him, reached not to him only, but to his Father who sent him. There are also other things in little children commended to us in holy writ, but this is manifestly what our Saviour here intends. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-1.htm" title="At the same time came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?">Matthew 18:1</a>"</span> and following verses to <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-5.htm" title="And whoever shall receive one such little child in my name receives me.">Matthew 18:5</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he sat down,.... As their master, as one having authority; and in order to examine into this matter, and pass judgment upon it: <p>and called the twelve; all the disciples, who though they might not be all engaged in this dispute, nor equally criminal, yet were all, possessed of the same notion; and therefore Christ calls them all unto him, what he had to say, being pertinent unto them all: <p>and saith unto them, if any man desire to be first; to have the pre-eminence, and be in the chief place in the kingdom of the Messiah, <p>the same shall be last of all, and servant of all: his pride and vanity shall be checked; his ambitious views shall be frustrated; instead of being first, he shall be last; and instead of having superior reverence and respect, he shall be debased, and treated with neglect and contempt; and instead of being the master over others, shall be the servant of all. Some copies read, "let him be"; and so the Persic version, "let him be last, and minister to every one"; and the Ethiopic thus, "let him subject himself to all, and be servant to all"; for the only way to preferment in Christ's kingdom, or in the Gospel dispensation, is humility and meekness, and performing the lowest services to all, with diligence and cheerfulness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/9.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-35.htm" title="And he sat down, and called the twelve, and said to them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.">Mark 9:35</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ καθίσας</span>, etc.: every word here betokens a deliberate attempt to school the disciples in humility.

He sat down, with the authority of the great Teacher, to inculcate solemnly a fundamental principle of the Christian life. <span class="cmt_word">If any man would be first he shall be last of all, and minister of all</span>. These words are capable of two interpretations. They might be regarded as analogous to our Lord's words elsewhere, "He that exalteth himself shall be abased;" as though they indicated the penalty which attaches to unworthy ambition. But it is surely far more natural to regard them as pointing out the way to real greatness, namely, by humble service for Christ's sake. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Servant (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., minister. Probably from &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c9; to pursue; to be the follower of a person; to attach one's self to him. As distinguished from other words in the New Testament meaning servant, this represents the servant in his activity; while &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, slave, represents him in his condition or relation as a bondman. A &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, may be either a slave or a freeman. The word deacon is an almost literal transcription of the original.
