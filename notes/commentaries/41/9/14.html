Doubtless they took the opportunity of their Master’s absence to expose and distress them. <span class="ital">And all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed </span>— At his coming so suddenly, so seasonably, so unexpectedly: perhaps, also, at some unusual rays of majesty and glory, which yet remained on his countenance; as, it seems, Moses’s face shone several hours after he had been with God on the mount. <span class="ital">And running to him, saluted him </span>— With the greatest marks of respect and affection. The scribes and Pharisees, however, without regarding his return, continued their ill-natured attacks on his disciples. <span class="ital">And he asked the scribes </span>— Namely, when the salutations of the multitude were over. <span class="ital">What question ye with them? </span>— What is the subject of your dispute with them?

They did not care to repeat what they had said to his disciples: but <span class="ital">one of the multitude said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, </span>&c. — From the narrative which this man gives, in answer to what Jesus said to the scribes, it appears that they had been disputing about the cure of this youth, which the disciples had unsuccessfully attempted. And probably their want of success had given the scribes occasion to boast that a devil was found that neither the disciples nor their Master was able to cast out.

Very much is promised to our believing. If thou canst believe, it is possible that thy hard heart may be softened, thy spiritual diseases may be cured; and, weak as thou art, thou mayest be able to hold out to the end. Those that complain of unbelief, must look up to Christ for grace to help them against it, and his grace will be sufficient for them. Whom Christ cures, he cures effectually. But Satan is unwilling to be driven from those that have been long his slaves, and, when he cannot deceive or destroy the sinner, he will cause him all the terror that he can.

And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them&#8212;This was "on the next day, when they were come down from the hill" (Lu 9:37). The Transfiguration appears to have taken place at night. In the morning, as He came down from the hill on which it took place&#8212;with Peter, and James, and John&#8212;on approaching the other nine, He found them surrounded by a great multitude, and the scribes disputing or discussing with them. No doubt these cavillers were twitting the apostles of Jesus with their inability to cure the demoniac boy of whom we are presently to hear, and insinuating doubts even of their Master's ability to do it; while they, zealous for their Master's honor, would no doubt refer to His past miracles in proof of the contrary.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/mark/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 14-16. When Christ came down from the mountain of transfiguration to his disciples, whom he had left at the foot of the mountain, he saw a great multitude got together about them, and discerned some scribes (companions of the Pharisees and teachers of the law) mixing themselves with his disciples, and arguing with them. They had often attempted our Saviour to no purpose but their own shame and confusion; in his absence they fall in with his disciples, who were yet raw in the faith; over them they hope to get a great conquest. The evangelist doth not plainly tell us what the subject matter of their discourse was. Though there be no question but the scribes in this discourse pursued their design to expose and vilify Christ and his disciples, and to that purpose, taking advantage of our Saviour’s absence, discoursed with them about many things, yet Mr. Calvin doth (not improbably) judge that a great part of their discourse was about our Saviour’s casting out of devils, and their power in that thing derived from him, they being at the present nonplussed, and not able to exert that power in the casting out of a devil, with which one was possessed, who in our Saviour’s absence was brought to them. That which maketh this probable is, not only that this act of our Saviour more troubled and galled them than any other, and put them to that miserable refuge, (out of which our Saviour had lately beaten them), to say, That he cast out devils by Beelzebub the prince of devils; but also that when our Saviour, coming in to the timely rescue of his disciples, <span class="ital">asked the scribes, What question</span> <span class="ital">ye with them?</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when he came to his disciples,....

The narrative of Mark is more original, characteristic, fresher, and, for the most part, more detailed than the other two.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">συζητ</span>.] according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/9-16.htm" title="And he asked the scribes, What question you with them?...">Mark 9:16-18</a>, on occasion of the circumstance that the disciples had not been able to perform the cure, and so concerning their power of miracles which was now so doubtful.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐξεθαμβ</span>.] <span class="ital">they were very much amazed</span> (Orph. <span class="ital">Arg.</span> 1217; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/30-9.htm" title="Cocker thy child, and he shall make thee afraid: play with him, and he will bring thee to heaviness.">Sir 30:9</a>; Polyb. xx. 10. 9 : <span class="greekheb">ἔκθαμβοι γεγονότες</span>; in the N. T., used by Mark only). But <span class="ital">at what</span>? Euthymius Zigabenus leaves the open choice between two explanations: <span class="ital">either</span> at the approach of Jesus so exactly opportune, <span class="ital">or</span> at the brightness of His countenance (<span class="greekheb">καὶ γὰρ εἰκὸς ἐφέλκεσθαί τινα χάριν ἐκ τῆς μεταμορφώσεως</span>, comp. Bengel, de Wette, Bisping). But the <span class="ital">latter</span> must have been <span class="ital">expressed</span>; moreover, this cause of astonishment would rather have been followed by a remaining at a distance than a <span class="greekheb">προστρέχειν</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀσπάζειν</span>. Hence (comp. also Bleek) the <span class="ital">first</span> explanation of Euthymius Zigabenus (comp. Theophylact and Victor Antiochenus) is, in accordance with the connection, to be preferred. It was <span class="ital">the amazement of joyously startled surprise</span>, that, whilst the disciples, who had not been able to help, were in so critical a situation, as was also the father with his unfortunate son, just at that moment the mighty miracle-worker Himself came to their aid. According to Fritzsche, there is denoted generally: “<span class="ital">quanta fuerit Jesu … et admiratio in plebe et veneratio</span>.” Much too general and aloof from the context. According to Lange, what is meant is, “the <span class="ital">starting back</span> of a multitude, that had become somewhat <span class="ital">profanely</span> disposed, at the sudden emergence of a manifestation <span class="ital">of punishment</span>”. But Mark has nothing of these psychological presuppositions, and <span class="greekheb">προστρέχοντες κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is not in keeping therewith. According to Baur, <span class="ital">Markusev.</span> p. 70, Mark has only attributed to the people the impression, “with which <span class="ital">he himself</span> accompanied the Lord, as He descended from the mount of transfiguration.” With such modes of dealing all exegesis is at an end.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-16.htm" title="And he asked the scribes, What question you with them?">Mark 9:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐπηρώτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτούς</span>] This <span class="greekheb">αὐτούς</span> cannot without arbitrariness be referred to any but those mentioned immediately before—therefore to the <span class="ital">people</span>,[124] who are accordingly to be conceived, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-14.htm" title="And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.">Mark 9:14</a>, as likewise taking part in the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΖΗΤΕῖΝ</span></span></span>, so that there <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΖΗΤΟῦΝΤΑς</span></span></span> also applies jointly to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὌΧΛΟΝ ΠΟΛΎΝ</span></span></span>. So also Bleek; comp. Ewald. The usual reference to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΡΑΜΜΑΤΕῖς</span></span></span> is consequently to be rejected (although Fritzsche adopts this, and Lange, who, however, assumes a <span class="ital">sympathetic</span> participation of the people); and so, too, is the reference to the <span class="ital">disciples and scribes</span> (Griesbach, Paulus, Kuinoel), or merely to <span class="ital">the disciples</span> (Mill, Bengel).

With the <span class="ital">Recepta</span> <span class="greekheb">πιστεῦσαι</span> or <span class="greekheb">δύνῃ</span> the explanation is: <span class="ital">if thou canst believe</span> (I will help thee); <span class="ital">everything is possible</span>, etc., in which interpretation, however, the <span class="greekheb">τό</span> is without warrant disregarded, as if it were of no significance (but comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-18.htm" title="He said to him, Which? Jesus said, You shall do no murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,">Matthew 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-37.htm" title="For I say to you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.">Luke 22:37</a>), and taken only “as a sign of quotation of the direct discourse” (de Wette). So also Linder in the Stud. u. Krit. 1862, p. 559. Lachmann[125] places no point at all after <span class="greekheb">πιστεῦσαι</span>, and we might accordingly explain it thus: <span class="ital">if thou art in a position to believe that everything is possible to him that believeth</span> (so in my second edition). But even thus the <span class="greekheb">τό</span> causes difficulty, and the thought and the expression would be too diffuse, not in keeping with the concise representation of Mark, especially in so impassioned a connection. Lange takes it thus: “the <span class="ital">if thou canst</span> means: canst <span class="ital">believe</span>.” How enigmatically would Jesus have so spoken! Bleek takes <span class="greekheb">εἰ</span> <span class="ital">interrogatively</span>. But neither the deliberative character of this question (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-10.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.">Matthew 12:10</a>) nor the <span class="greekheb">τό</span> would be appropriate. Bengel’s interpretation also is impossible: ‘Hoc, <span class="ital">si potes credere</span>, res est; hoc agitur.” But he well observes on the state of the case: “Omnipotentiae divinae se fides hominis quasi organon accommodat ad recipiendum, vel etiam ad agendum.” Fritzsche has <span class="ital">conjectured</span> either: <span class="greekheb">εἶπεν αὐτῷ</span>· <span class="greekheb">εἰ δύνασαι</span>; <span class="greekheb">πίστευε</span>· <span class="greekheb">πάντα δυνατὰ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., or: <span class="greekheb">εἶπεν αὐτῷ</span>· <span class="greekheb">τί ἐστι τὸ εἰ δύνασαι</span>; <span class="greekheb">πίστευε</span>· <span class="greekheb">πάντα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., and Bornemann, <span class="ital">l.c.</span> p. 123: <span class="greekheb">εἶπεν αὐτῷ τὸ πάντα δυνατὰ τῷ πιστ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-24.htm" title="And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help you my unbelief.">Mark 9:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">βοήθει μου τῇ ἀπιστίᾳ</span>] <span class="ital">help me unbelieving</span>; refuse me not Thy help, notwithstanding my unbelief. Calovius, Bengel,[126] and many others render: <span class="ital">assist my unbelief</span>, strengthen my weak faith, which, however, is at variance with the contextual meaning of <span class="greekheb">βοήθει</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-22.htm" title="And often it has cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if you can do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.">Mark 9:22</a>). Moreover, the answer of the father, who has just said <span class="greekheb">πιστεύω</span>, but immediately afterwards, in consideration of the greatness of the issue made to depend on his faith, designates this faith in respect of its degree as <span class="greekheb">ἀπιστία</span>, is quite in keeping with the alternation of vehemently excited feeling. Victor Antiochenus rightly says: <span class="greekheb">διάφορός ἐστιν ἡ πίστις</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἡ μὲν εἰσαγωγικὴ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἡ δὲ τελεία</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">substantive</span> <span class="greekheb">τῇ ἀπιστίᾳ</span> brings more strongly into prominence the condition than would have been done by an adjective. See Winer, p. 211 [E. T. 296]. And the prefixed <span class="greekheb">μου</span> represents at the same time the <span class="ital">mihi</span> of interest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-30.htm" title="And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?">Mark 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-14.htm" title="If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.">Romans 11:14</a>, and frequently Stallbaum, <span class="ital">ad Plat.

This would seem to confirm the supposition that the transfiguration took place in the night. All the synoptists agree in placing the following immediately after the transfiguration. Scribes were questioning with the disciples who had bee left behind. As they had assembled in the neigh-where Jesus was, for the purpose of watching him. Their object in questioning with the disciples was doubtless to throw discredit upon Jesus, because they, disciples, had failed to work the miracle. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The scribes<p>The particularizing of the scribes as the questioners, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-15.htm">Mark 9:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-16.htm">Mark 9:16</a>, are peculiar to Mark. </body></html>
