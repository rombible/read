A glimpse of that kingdom was given in the transfiguration of Christ. It is good to be away from the world, and alone with Christ: and how good to be with Christ glorified in heaven with all the saints! But when it is well with us, we are apt not to care for others, and in the fulness of our enjoyments, we forget the many wants of our brethren. God owns Jesus, and accepts him as his beloved Son, and is ready to accept us in him. Therefore we must own and accept him as our beloved Saviour, and must give up ourselves to be ruled by him. Christ does not leave the soul, when joys and comforts leave it. Jesus explained to the disciples the prophecy about Elias.

Allowing that their observation was right, and that this was the sense of the Scribes, and that there was something of truth in it, when rightly understood: <p>Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things: See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-11.htm">Matthew 17:11</a>; <p>and how it is written of the son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought. The sense of Christ is, that John the Baptist, whom he means by Elias, comes first, and restores all things: and among the rest of the things he sets right, this is one, and not of the least; namely, that he gives the true sense of such passages of the sacred writings, which related to the contemptuous usage, rejection, and sufferings of the Messiah; as that in these he was the Lamb of God typified in the sacrifices of the law, who by his sufferings and death takes away the sin, of the world; and therefore he exhorted and directed those to whom he ministered, to look unto him, and believe in him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/9.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-12.htm" title="And he answered and told them, Elias truly comes first, and restores all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nothing.">Mark 9:12</a>. The construction of this sentence also is somewhat puzzling. After <span class="greekheb">Ἡλίας</span> comes <span class="greekheb">μὲν</span> in the best MSS., raising expectation of a <span class="greekheb">δὲ</span> in the apodosis, instead of which we have <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> (<span class="greekheb">πῶς γέγραπται</span>). Examples of such substitution occur in classic authors; concerning which Klotz, <span class="ital">Devar.</span>, p. 659, remarks: when <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὲ</span>, or the like are put for <span class="greekheb">δὲ</span> after <span class="greekheb">μὲν</span>, it is not properly a case of construction, but rather: “quaedam quasi legitima orationis <span class="greekheb">ἀνακολουθία</span>”. Perhaps we are at a loss from merely <span class="ital">reading</span> the words instead of hearing them spoken with a pause between first and second half of sentence, thus: Elias, indeed, coming first, restoreth all things (so teach the scribes)—and how stands it written about the Son of Man?—that He should suffer many things and be set at nought! The aim is to awaken thought in the mind of the disciples by putting together things incongruous. All things to be restored in preparation for Messiah; Messiah Himself to suffer and be set at nought: what then can the real function and fate of Elijah the restorer be? Who <span class="ital">is</span> Elijah?—<span class="greekheb">ἐξουδενηθῆ</span>: this form, found in [74] [75] and adopted by W.H[76], is rare. The verb occurs in three forms—<span class="greekheb">ἐξουδενέω</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐξουδενόω</span> (T.R.), <span class="greekheb">ἐξουθενέω</span>; the latter two in more common use. The word in any form is late Greek. <span class="ital">Vide</span> Grimm’s <span class="ital">Lexicon</span>, and Lobeck, Phryn., p. 181 (from <span class="greekheb">ἐξ</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐδέν</span> or <span class="greekheb">οὐθέν</span>=to treat as nought).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[74] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[75] Codex Bezae<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[76] Westcott and Hort.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/mark/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">and how</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">but how is it written of the Son of Man that He must suffer many things and he set at naught?</span> See Tischendorf, <span class="ital">Synop.
