A glimpse of that kingdom was given in the transfiguration of Christ. It is good to be away from the world, and alone with Christ: and how good to be with Christ glorified in heaven with all the saints! But when it is well with us, we are apt not to care for others, and in the fulness of our enjoyments, we forget the many wants of our brethren. God owns Jesus, and accepts him as his beloved Son, and is ready to accept us in him. Therefore we must own and accept him as our beloved Saviour, and must give up ourselves to be ruled by him. Christ does not leave the soul, when joys and comforts leave it. Jesus explained to the disciples the prophecy about Elias. This was very suitable to the ill usage of John Baptist.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He wist not - He "knew not."

The Persic version reads, "he was": and so the Latin translation of the Syriac, though that itself is, "they were"; for all three were filled with consternation at what they saw and heard; so that they were scarcely themselves, and knew not well what they said or did. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For he wist not what to say; for they were sore <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> afraid.</span><p>(c) They were beside themselves with fear.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/9.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-6.htm" title="For he knew not what to say; for they were sore afraid.">Mark 9:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">τί ἀποκριθῇ</span>, what he should answer—to the vision; he did not know what else to make of it than that Moses and Elijah had come to stay.
