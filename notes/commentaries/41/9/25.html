Very much is promised to our believing. If thou canst believe, it is possible that thy hard heart may be softened, thy spiritual diseases may be cured; and, weak as thou art, thou mayest be able to hold out to the end. Those that complain of unbelief, must look up to Christ for grace to help them against it, and his grace will be sufficient for them. Whom Christ cures, he cures effectually. But Satan is unwilling to be driven from those that have been long his slaves, and, when he cannot deceive or destroy the sinner, he will cause him all the terror that he can. The disciples must not think to do their work always with the same ease; some services call for more than ordinary pains.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Said with tears - The man felt the implied rebuke in the Saviour's language; and feeling grieved that he should be thought to be destitute of faith, and feeling deeply for the welfare of his afflicted son, he wept. Nothing can be more touching or natural than this. An anxious father, distressed at the condition of his son, having applied to the disciples in vain, now coming to the Saviour; and not having full confidence that he had the proper qualification to be aided, he wept. Any man would have wept in his condition, nor would the Saviour turn the weeping suppliant away.<p>I believe - I have faith. I do put confidence in thee, though I know that my faith is not as strong as it should be.<p>Lord - This word here signifies merely "master," or "sir," as it does often in the New Testament. We have no evidence that he had any knowledge of the divine nature of the Saviour, and he applied the word, probably, as he would have done to any other teacher or worker of miracles.<p>Help thou mine unbelief - Supply thou the defects of my faith. Give me strength and grace to put "entire" confidence in thee. Everyone who comes to the Saviour for help has need of offering this prayer. In our unbelief and our doubts we need his aid, nor shall we ever put sufficient reliance on him without his gracious help. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe: help thou mine unbelief&#8212;that is, "It is useless concealing from Thee, O Thou mysterious, mighty Healer, the unbelief that still struggles in this heart of mine; but that heart bears me witness that I do believe in Thee; and if distrust still remains, I disown it, I wrestle with it, I seek help from Thee against it." Two things are very remarkable here: First, The felt and owned presence of unbelief, which only the strength of the man's faith could have so revealed to his own consciousness. Second, His appeal to Christ for help against his felt unbelief&#8212;a feature in the case quite unparalleled, and showing, more than all protestations could have done, the insight he had attained into the existence of a power in Christ more glorious them any he had besought for his poor child. The work was done; and as the commotion and confusion in the crowd was now increasing, Jesus at once, as Lord of spirits, gives the word of command to the dumb and deaf spirit to be gone, never again to return to his victim.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/mark/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-17.htm" title="And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought to you my son, which has a dumb spirit;">Mark 9:17</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>When Jesus saw that the people came running together,....  "to him", as the Syriac version adds, and so the Persic; upon hearing the vehement cry of the father of the child, and the earnest solicitations he made, expecting that something would be done: <p>he rebuked the foul spirit; that brought this disorder on the child, had continued it so long, and with so much violence. Matthew calls this foul spirit, "the devil"; see Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-18.htm">Matthew 17:18</a>, <p>saying unto him, thou dumb and deaf spirit; so calling him, not because the spirit was dumb and deaf, but because he had been the cause of dumbness and deafness in the child: he had at times taken away both his speech and hearing: <p>I charge thee come out of him, and enter no more into him. Christ, in an authoritative way, ordered the unclean spirit to leave his possession, and never attempt to regain it more. This he said, partly with regard to the devil, who would be desirous of repossession; and partly with respect to the disease, which had its intervals, and returned at certain times; and also with respect to the father of the child, to confirm his faith in the cure, and that he might be in no pain about the return of the disorder. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/9.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/9-25.htm" title="When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying to him, You dumb and deaf spirit, I charge you, come out of him, and enter no more into him....">Mark 9:25-29</a>. <span class="ital">The cure</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπισυντρέχει</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἅπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λεγ</span>.) indicates that the crowd was constantly increasing, so becoming a new crowd (<span class="greekheb">ὄχλος</span> without art.); natural in the circumstances.

And now, when they noticed that he had taken the father apart, as no doubt he had done, to question him they <span class="cmt_word">came running together</span> (the word is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, an unusual word, meaning "they ran together to the place") where he was, crowding upon him. Then he came forward, and with a voice of sublime authority he said, <span class="cmt_word">Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him and enter no more into him.</span> The rest of the narrative shows how malignant and powerful this evil spirit was, who dared so to resist and defy Christ that, in his departure out of the afflicted boy, he almost robbed him of life. "Most unwillingly," says Archbishop Trench, "does the evil spirit depart, seeking to destroy that which he can no longer retain." And he quotes Fuller, who says that he is "like an outgoing tenant, that cares not what mischief he does to the house that he is quitting." Some have supposed that this was an evil spirit possessed of more than ordinary power as well as malignity, and that this was the reason why our Lord's disciples could not cast him out; so that this expulsion needed the mighty arm of One stronger than the strong. The words in the Greek are powerful, severe, and authoritative: "He rebuked (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>) the unclean spirit, ... Thou dumb and deaf spirit (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>), I command thee (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>), come out of him, and enter no more into him." This explains our Lord's words when the disciples remarked afterwards, <span class="cmt_word">We could not out it out... This kind can come out by nothing, save by prayer</span>; that is, this particular kind of malicious spirit. For there are different degrees of malice and energy in evil spirits as in evil men. The words "and fasting" are added in many ancient authorities. </body></html>
