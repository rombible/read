It indicates something of the same zeal as that which desired that fire might come from heaven to consume the Samaritans who refused to receive our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-52.htm" title="And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.">Luke 9:52</a>). The words were so far an “answer” to what our Lord had said, that they were suggested by it. The disciple desired to show, as in self-vindication, that he not only “received” his Master, but that he was unwilling to “receive” any who did not openly follow Him as a disciple. The fact of which he speaks is significant historically as indicating that one of the effects of our Lord’s work had been to stir up and quicken the spiritual powers of men outside the range of the company of disciples that gathered round Him. They believed in Him, or they would not have used His Name. They were fellow-workers with Him, for they were seeking to rescue the souls of men from frenzy and despair. Their faith was effective, for, as the narrative implies, they not only claimed the power to cast out <span class= "ital">demons,</span> but did cast them out. The case stood, it is obvious, on an entirely different footing from that of the sons of Sceva, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/19-13.htm" title="Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took on them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.">Acts 19:13-14</a>, which at first sight seems to resemble it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/mark/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/9-38.htm" title="And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in your name, and he follows not us: and we forbade him, because he follows not us....">Mark 9:38-40</a></span>. <span class="ital">And John answered him </span>— As if he had said, But ought we to receive those who <span class="ital">follow not us?

St. Paul had learned a better temper, when he <span class="ital">rejoiced that Christ </span>was <span class="ital">preached, </span>even by those who were his personal enemies. But to confine religion to them that follow us, is a narrowness of spirit which we should avoid and abhor. <span class="ital">Jesus said, </span>&c. — Christ here gives us a lovely example of candour and moderation. He was willing to put the best construction on doubtful cases, and to treat as friends those who were not avowed enemies. Perhaps in this instance it was a means of conquering the remainder of prejudice, and perfecting what was wanting in the faith and obedience of these persons. <span class="ital">Forbid him not </span>— Neither directly nor indirectly discourage or hinder any man, who brings sinners from the power of Satan to God, <span class="ital">because he followeth not us, </span>in opinions, modes of worship, or any thing else which does not affect the essence of religion. <span class="ital">For he that is not against us, is for us — </span>Our Lord had formerly said, He that is not with me, is against me: thereby admonishing his hearers that the war between him and Satan admitted of no neutrality, and that those who were indifferent to him now, would finally be treated as enemies. But here, in another view, he uses a very different proverb; directing his followers to judge of men’s characters in the most candid manner; and charitably to hope, that those who did not oppose his cause wished well to it. Upon the whole, we are to be <span class="ital">rigorous </span>in judging ourselves, and <span class="ital">candid </span>in judging each other.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/mark/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:30-40 The time of Christ's suffering drew nigh. Had he been delivered into the hands of devils, and they had done this, it had not been so strange; but that men should thus shamefully treat the Son of man, who came to redeem and save them, is wonderful. Still observe that when Christ spake of his death, he always spake of his resurrection, which took the reproach of it from himself, and should have taken the grief of it from his disciples. Many remain ignorant because they are ashamed to inquire. Alas! that while the Saviour teaches so plainly the things which belong to his love and grace, men are so blinded that they understand not his sayings. We shall be called to account about our discourses, and to account for our disputes, especially about being greater than others. Those who are most humble and self-denying, most resemble Christ, and shall be most tenderly owned by him. This Jesus taught them by a sign; whoever shall receive one like this child, receives me. Many have been like the disciples, ready to silence men who have success in preaching to sinners repentance in Christ's name, because they follow not with them. Our Lord blamed the apostles, reminding them that he who wrought miracles in his name would not be likely to hurt his cause. If sinners are brought to repent, to believe in the Saviour, and to live sober, righteous, and godly lives, we then see that the Lord works by the preacher.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We saw one ... - There is no improbability in supposing that this might have been one of the disciples of John, or one of the seventy whom Jesus had sent out, and who, though he did not "personally" attend on Jesus, yet had the power of working miracles.

Here a question arises worthy of our discussion a little: Seeing these miraculous operations were performed by a Divine power, and for such an end as the confirmation of Christ’s Divine power, how could any one cast out devils in the name of Christ, and yet not follow him and his disciples? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. It is apparent that this person was no enemy to Christ or his gospel, by what our Saviour saith, both in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-39.htm" title="But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.">Mark 9:39</a></span> and in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-40.htm" title="For he that is not against us is on our part.">Mark 9:40</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. It is evident that the casting out of devils was no saving effect of the Holy Spirit. Christ saith, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-22.htm" title="Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name? and in your name have cast out devils? and in your name done many wonderful works?">Matthew 7:22</a></span>, that some should say, <span class="ital">In thy name have we cast out devils, </span> to whom in the day of judgment he would say, <span class="ital">Depart from me, </span> I know you not, <span class="ital">ye that work</span> <span class="ital">iniquity.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. It is plain that this man was no such person as Sceva’s sons, of whom we read <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/19-14.htm" title="And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so....">Acts 19:14-16</a></span>, for the devils resisted them, though they also used the name of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It was a time exceedingly famous for some of the more extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost, and it is not to be wondered if some in this time, for the glory of God, received some crumbs of that plentiful benevolence, though they were but imperfect disciples, yet being no enemies. Caiaphas prophesied, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-51.htm" title="And this spoke he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;">John 11:51</a>,52</span>; and though I do think that the children of the Pharisees, mentioned, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-27.htm" title="And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.">Matthew 12:27</a></span>, as persons that cast out devils, is best interpreted of those sent out by Christ, (the twelve and the seventy), yet some are of another mind. Some think this man, though he did not follow Christ and his disciples as a constant companion, yet was one who favoured and had received the gospel; or else one of John’s disciples, and so one who, though he was not formally joined with the followers of Christ, yet was a friend of that great Bridegroom. So as John and the rest, forbidding him, seemed to be guilty of two no small errors: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Envying for Christ’s sake, as Joshua did for Moses’s sake, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-28.htm" title="And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.">Numbers 11:28</a></span>, as John’s disciples did for their master’s sake, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-26.htm" title="And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bore witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him.">John 3:26</a></span>, willing that Christ, and those whom he sent out, should have all the honour of those miraculous operations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Limiting the grace of Christ to that congregation which followed Christ, and the twelve; a thing that good men are too prone unto. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>How much better was the spirit of Paul, who tells us, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-15.htm" title="Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:">Philippians 1:15</a>,18</span>, that although some preached Christ of envy and strife, yet he rejoiced, and would rejoice, that Christ was preached, whether in pretence, or in truth. Christ would have all his people of such a spirit, as not to hinder, but commend, not to envy, but to rejoice in the doing of good by any, whether they did follow him or did not. Some think that at that time it pleased God, that, for the honour of his Son Jesus Christ, he did concur with those that named his name in such miraculous operations. Sure we are that Christ reproveth John, and commandeth them not to forbid this man, giving this for a reason, That his owning the name of Christ, so far as to use it in such an operation, had at least so much kindness for him as he was no enemy, he would not curse him, nor speak evil of him; which cometh up to that of the apostle, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm" title="Why I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.">1 Corinthians 12:3</a></span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">No man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed; and no</span> <span class="ital">man can say Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. For he that is</span> <span class="ital">not against us is on our part:</span> if a man be not an open enemy to Christ, he ought to be presumed to be his friend, at least so far as not to be discouraged in doing a good work. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And John answered him, saying,.... Taking notice of what Christ just now said, and observing how well pleasing it was to him, to receive in a meek and humble manner, the least believer in his name; and reflecting upon an action, in which he and some of his fellow disciples were concerned, and which he perceived was not so agreeable to this rule of Christ, thought proper to relate it to him; that he might have his sense of it, and give him an opportunity of enlarging on a subject, so suitable to the temper and disposition of this beloved disciple. <p>Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name: very likely he called him Rabbi, as the Syriac version renders it, or Rabboni, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-16.htm">John 20:16</a>, a title commonly given to Christ, both by his disciples and others: the case related, very probably happened, when the disciples being sent forth by Christ to preach the Gospel and cast out devils, took a tour through Judea and Galilee, where they saw this man. John was not alone; there were others with him, at least another, who was an eyewitness with him; for the apostles were sent out, by two and two: who this man was, is not said, his name is not mentioned, perhaps was unknown to the apostles; though Beza says, in one ancient exemplar it is read, "we knew one". This person not only attempted to cast out devils, but really did; and that more than one; but in which of Christ's names he did it, is not expressed; if in the name of the Messiah, Dr. Lightfoot's conjecture may be right, that he was one of John's disciples; who had been baptized in the name of the Messiah, that was just expected to come; to whom, as to others of his disciples, was given a power of casting out devils, to make the way of the Messiah more plain; wherefore the reason why he did not cast out devils in the name of Jesus, but in the name of the Messiah, and did not follow him, nor his disciples, was not out of contempt, but ignorance, not knowing that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah: or if he cast out devils in the name of Jesus, which seems most likely, he might be, as others think, a disciple of John's, who really did believe in Jesus, though he did not associate with, his disciples, but continued with the disciples of John: wherefore it is said, <p>and he followeth not us; was neither one of the twelve apostles; nor one of the seventy disciples; nor even one of the lower class of the professed disciples of Jesus. This clause is omitted in the Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions: <p>and we forbad him; going on in this way, casting out any more devils: <p>because he followeth, not us; was not one of their company, nor any of Christ's disciples; who had received no authority and commission from Christ, to do what he did: wherefore they feared, that by such an irregular way of proceeding, the dignity of Christ would be lessened, and some dishonour and reproach reflected on him: and besides the honour of Christ, they might consult their own; and their case be too much like that of Joshua, when Eldad and Medad prophesied in the camp. This clause is left out in the Vulgate Latin, but stands in all the eastern versions. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.</span><p>(9) God, who normally works through ordinary means, works also extraordinarily as often as it pleases him.

If Christ, and faith in Him, has place in little children [<span class="ital">of whom not even the one, of whom mention is made in</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-36.htm" title="And he took a child, and set him in the middle of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said to them,">Mark 9:36</a>, <span class="ital">was following Jesus</span>.—V. g.], it might also have place in that person, whom they had forbidden. Hence there is manifested the moderation of John and his candour: he seems to have carried this doubt for some time in his breast, until he could, at a suitable opportunity, bring it forward.—<span class="greekheb">ἡμῖν</span>—<span class="greekheb">ἡμῖν</span>, <span class="ital">us</span>) The apostles, in subordination to Thee.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - This verse, according to the best authorities, should begin simply, <span class="cmt_word">John said unto him</span> - although in St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-49.htm">Luke 9:49</a>) they stand, "And John answered and said" - <span class="cmt_word">Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name: and we forbade him, because he followed not us</span>. The casting out of evil spirits was one of the foremost  signs of apostleship; and what surprised St. John was that one who followed not Christ should have been able to work this miracle - a miracle in which, it will be remembered, the disciples had recently failed. It thus appears that our Lord's teaching had been so influential, that some, not reckoned amongst his disciples, had shown this proof of a strong and overpowering faith. We know that there were those in our Savior's time, of Jewish race, who cast out devils (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-27.htm">Matthew 12:27</a>). And Justin Martyr, in his 'Dialogue with Trypho the Jew,' states that while exorcism, as practiced by the Jews, often failed when it was <span class="accented">attempted to</span> be exercised "by the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," was eminently successful when administered "by the name of the Son of God, who was born of a virgin and crucified under Pontius Pilate" (c. 85). That spirit has power over spirit in many mysterious ways is one of those truths which science has not yet been able to explain (see Dr. Morison on St. Mark, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). To return, however, to the instance here alluded to by St. John, it should be observed that they who acted thus had faith in Christ; and that by thus acting with him and for him, though not amongst his recognized followers, they contributed towards his honor who, by means of these imperfect instruments, carried out the great purpose of his manifestation, namely," to destroy the works of the devil." Then further, the disciples forbade them not out of envy or hatred, but out of zeal for Christ, as though they were thus serving his cause and upholding his honor. But this was" a zeal, not according to knowledge." They had forbidden them, without having first taken counsel of their Master. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/mark/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>In thy name<p>John's conscience is awakened by the Lord's words.
