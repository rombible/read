This is the natural sense which is to be expected from the context, since it can hardly be imagined that the victims would be burnt with the feathers, and thus cause an intolerable smell. The rendering, however, given in the margin, <span class= "ital">“with the filth thereof,” </span>is now adopted by the greater number of expositors. As the two words <span class= "ital">filth </span>and <span class= "ital">feathers </span>resemble each other in Hebrew, it is probable that one of them has dropped out of the text. The maw, therefore, with its contents, as well as the feathers, were removed to the eastern side of the altar, where the ashes from the altar were thrown (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-3.htm" title="Or have found that which was lost, and lies concerning it, and swears falsely; in any of all these that a man does, sinning therein:">Leviticus 6:3</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-16.htm" title="And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:">Leviticus 1:16</a></span>. <span class="ital">With its feathers — </span>Or, <span class="ital">with its dung, or filth, </span>contained in the crop and in the guts. <span class="ital">On the east — </span>Of the tabernacle.

Those creatures were chosen for sacrifice which were mild, and gentle, and harmless; to show the innocence and meekness that were in Christ, and that should be in Christians. The offering of the poor was as typical of Christ's atonement as the more costly sacrifices, and expressed as fully repentance, faith, and devotedness to God. We have no excuse, if we refuse the pleasant and reasonable service now required. But we can no more offer the sacrifice of a broken heart, or of praise and thanksgiving, than an Israelite could offer a bullock or a goat, except as God hath first given to us. The more we do in the Lord's service, the greater are our obligations to him, for the will, for the ability, and opportunity. In many things God leaves us to fix what shall be spent in his service, whether of our time or our substance; yet where God's providence has put much into a man's power, scanty offerings will not be accepted, for they are not proper expressions of a willing mind. Let us be devoted in body and soul to his service, whatever he may call us to give, venture, do, or suffer for his sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His crop with his feathers - The weight of authority is in favor of the marginal rendering. It is most probable that the feathers were burned with the body, and that the wings, mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-17.htm">Leviticus 1:17</a>, were not mutilated.<p>The place of the ashes - The ashes were daily removed from the altar (except on certain holy days) and thrown into a heap on its eastern side. When the heap became inconveniently large, it was removed in vessels appropriated to the purpose (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-3.htm">Exodus 27:3</a>) to a spot without the camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-12.htm">Leviticus 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-11.htm">Leviticus 6:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14-17. if the burnt sacrifice &#8230; be of fowls&#8212;The gentle nature and cleanly habits of the dove led to its selection, while all other fowls were rejected, either for the fierceness of their disposition or the grossness of their taste; and in this case, there being from the smallness of the animal no blood for waste, the priest was directed to prepare it at the altar and sprinkle the blood. This was the offering appointed for the poor. The fowls were always offered in pairs, and the reason why Moses ordered two turtledoves or two young pigeons, was not merely to suit the convenience of the offerer, but according as the latter was in season; for pigeons are sometimes quite hard and unfit for eating, at which time turtledoves are very good in Egypt and Palestine. The turtledoves are not restricted to any age because they are always good when they appear in those countries, being birds of passage; but the age of the pigeons is particularly marked that they might not be offered to God at times when they are rejected by men [Harmer]. It is obvious, from the varying scale of these voluntary sacrifices, that the disposition of the offerer was the thing looked to&#8212;not the costliness of his offering.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">With his feathers, or, with its dung or filth</span>, to wit, contained in the crop, and in the guts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">On the east part, </span> to wit, of the tabernacle.

This was the rule with all the slain-offerings; although it is only in connection with the burnt-offerings, sin-offerings, and trespass-offerings (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-24.htm">Leviticus 4:24</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-29.htm">Leviticus 4:29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-33.htm">Leviticus 4:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-18.htm">Leviticus 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-2.htm">Leviticus 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-13.htm">Leviticus 14:13</a>) that it is expressly mentioned, whilst the indefinite expression "at the door (in front) of the tabernacle" is applied to the peace-offerings in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-8.htm">Leviticus 3:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-13.htm">Leviticus 3:13</a>, as it is to the trespass-offerings in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-4.htm">Leviticus 4:4</a>, from which the Rabbins have inferred, though hardly upon good ground, that the peace-offerings could be slaughtered in any part of the court. The northern side of the altar was appointed as the place of slaughtering, however, not from the idea that the Deity dwelt in the north (Ewald), for such an idea is altogether foreign to Mosaism, but, as Knobel supposes, probably because the table of shew-bread, with the continual meat-offering, stood on the north side in the holy place. Moreover, the eastern side of the altar in the court was the place for the refuse, or heap of ashes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-16.htm">Leviticus 1:16</a>); the ascent to the altar was probably on the south side, as Josephus affirms that it was in the second temple (J. de bell. jud. v. 5, 6); and the western side, or the space between the altar and the entrance to the holy place, would unquestionably have been the most unsuitable of all for the slaughtering.
