The imposition of hands upon the victim was dispensed with, both because the bird was too small for this ceremony, and because the offerer brought it in his hands to the place of sacrifice, thus conveying by this act the idea involved in the imposition of hands.<p><span class= "bld">And wring off his head.</span>—When the bird is handed to him, the priest is not to use any knife, but is to nip off its head with his nails, throw the severed head on the altar fire, and thus cause it to ascend in the sweet smelling savour.

Those creatures were chosen for sacrifice which were mild, and gentle, and harmless; to show the innocence and meekness that were in Christ, and that should be in Christians. The offering of the poor was as typical of Christ's atonement as the more costly sacrifices, and expressed as fully repentance, faith, and devotedness to God. We have no excuse, if we refuse the pleasant and reasonable service now required. But we can no more offer the sacrifice of a broken heart, or of praise and thanksgiving, than an Israelite could offer a bullock or a goat, except as God hath first given to us. The more we do in the Lord's service, the greater are our obligations to him, for the will, for the ability, and opportunity. In many things God leaves us to fix what shall be spent in his service, whether of our time or our substance; yet where God's providence has put much into a man's power, scanty offerings will not be accepted, for they are not proper expressions of a willing mind. Let us be devoted in body and soul to his service, whatever he may call us to give, venture, do, or suffer for his sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of turtledoves, or of young pigeons - The offering of a bird was permitted to one who was too poor to offer a quadruped. (Compare the marginal references.) But in certain rites of purification birds were appointed for all, whatever might be their circumstances. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-14.htm">Leviticus 15:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-29.htm">Leviticus 15:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-10.htm">Numbers 6:10</a>. The limitation of the age of the pigeons may be accounted for by the natural habits of the birds. It would seem that the species which are most likely to have been the sacrificial dove and pigeon are the common turtle and the bluerock pigeon, a bird like our stock-dove, and considerably larger than the turtle. The turtles come in the early part of April, but as the season advances they wholly disappear. The pigeons, on the contrary, do not leave the country; and their nests, with young ones in them, may be easily found at any season of the year. Hence, it would appear, that when turtledoves could not be obtained, nestling pigeons were accepted as a substitute. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14-17. if the burnt sacrifice &#8230; be of fowls&#8212;The gentle nature and cleanly habits of the dove led to its selection, while all other fowls were rejected, either for the fierceness of their disposition or the grossness of their taste; and in this case, there being from the smallness of the animal no blood for waste, the priest was directed to prepare it at the altar and sprinkle the blood. This was the offering appointed for the poor. The fowls were always offered in pairs, and the reason why Moses ordered two turtledoves or two young pigeons, was not merely to suit the convenience of the offerer, but according as the latter was in season; for pigeons are sometimes quite hard and unfit for eating, at which time turtledoves are very good in Egypt and Palestine. The turtledoves are not restricted to any age because they are always good when they appear in those countries, being birds of passage; but the age of the pigeons is particularly marked that they might not be offered to God at times when they are rejected by men [Harmer]. It is obvious, from the varying scale of these voluntary sacrifices, that the disposition of the offerer was the thing looked to&#8212;not the costliness of his offering.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Wring off his head, </span> to wit, from the rest of the body; as sufficiently appears, because this was to be burnt by itself, as it here follows, and the body afterwards, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-17.htm" title="And he shall split it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.">Leviticus 1:17</a></span>.

To this end they were to "put fire upon the altar" (of course this only applies to the first burnt-offering presented after the erection of the altar, as the fire was to be constantly burning upon the altar after that, without being allowed to go out, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-6.htm">Leviticus 6:6</a>), and to lay "wood in order upon the fire" (&#1506;&#1512;&#1498; to lay in regular order), and then to "lay the parts, the head and the fat, in order upon the wood on the fire," and thus to cause the whole to ascend in smoke. &#1508;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;, which is only used in connection with the burnt-offering (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-8.htm">Leviticus 1:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-12.htm">Leviticus 1:12</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-20.htm">Leviticus 8:20</a>), signifies, according to the ancient versions (lxx &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;) and the rabbinical writers, the fat, probably those portions of fat which were separated from the entrails and taken out to wash. Bochart's explanation is adeps a carne sejunctus. The head and fat are specially mentioned along with the pieces of flesh, partly because they are both separated from the flesh when animals are slaughtered, and partly also to point out distinctly that the whole of the animal ("all," <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>) was to be burned upon the altar, with the exception of the skin, which was given to the officiating priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-8.htm">Leviticus 7:8</a>), and the contents of the intestines. &#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;&#1512;, to cause to ascend in smoke and steam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7</a>), which is frequently construed with &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; towards the altar (&#1492; local, so used as to include position in a place; vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-13.htm">Leviticus 1:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-15.htm">Leviticus 1:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-17.htm">Leviticus 1:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-2.htm">Leviticus 2:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-9.htm">Leviticus 2:9</a>, etc.), or with &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-8.htm">Leviticus 6:8</a>), or &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-13.htm">Leviticus 9:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-17.htm">Leviticus 9:17</a>), was the technical expression for burning the sacrifice upon the altar, and showed that the intention was not simply to burn those portions of the sacrifice which were placed in the fire, i.e., to destroy, or turn them into ashes, but by this process of burning to cause the odour which was eliminated to ascend to heaven as the ethereal essence of the sacrifice, for a "firing of a sweet savour unto Jehovah." &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492;, firing ("an offering made by fire," Eng.
