Without this, the whole will seem unmeaning ceremonies. There is in these things a type of the sufferings of the Son of God, who was to be a sacrifice for the sins of the whole world? The burning body of an animal was but a faint representation of that everlasting misery, which we all have deserved; and which our blessed Lord bore in his body and in his soul, when he died under the load of our iniquities. Observe, 1. The beast to be offered must be without blemish. This signified the strength and purity that were in Christ, and the holy life that should be in his people. 2. The owner must offer it of his own free will. What is done in religion, so as to please God, must be done by love. Christ willingly offered himself for us. 3. It must be offered at the door of the tabernacle, where the brazen altar of burnt-offerings stood, which sanctified the gift: he must offer it at the door, as one unworthy to enter, and acknowledging that a sinner can have no communion with God, but by sacrifice. 4. The offerer must put his hand upon the head of his offering, signifying thereby, his desire and hope that it might be accepted from him, to make atonement for him. 5. The sacrifice was to be killed before the Lord, in an orderly manner, and to honour God. It signified also, that in Christians the flesh must be crucified with its corrupt affections and lust. 6. The priests were to sprinkle the blood upon the altar; for the blood being the life, that was it which made atonement. This signified the pacifying and purifying of our consciences, by the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ upon them by faith. 7. The beast was to be divided into several pieces, and then to be burned upon the altar. The burning of the sacrifice signified the sharp sufferings of Christ, and the devout affections with which, as a holy fire, Christians must offer up themselves, their whole spirit, soul, and body, unto God. 8. This is said to be an offering of a sweet savour. As an act of obedience to a Divine command, and a type of Christ, this was well-pleasing to God; and the spiritual sacrifices of Christians are acceptable to God, through Christ, 1Pe 2:5.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The parts of the victim were then salted by the priest in conformity with the rule, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-24.htm">Ezekiel 43:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-49.htm">Mark 9:49</a>, and placed IN ORDER upon the wood, i. e. in the same relation to each other that they had in the living animal. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. the fat&#8212;that about the kidneys especially, which is called "suet."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The fat; </span> all the fat, which was to be separated from the flesh, and to be put together, to increase the flame, and to consume the other parts of the sacrifice more quickly.

"If any one of you present an offering to Jehovah of cattle, ye shall present your offering from the herd and from the flock." &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1503; (Corban, from &#1492;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; to cause to draw near, to bring near, or present, an offering) is applied not only to the sacrifices, which were burned either in whole or in part upon the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-38.htm">Leviticus 7:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-9.htm">Numbers 18:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/28-2.htm">Numbers 28:2</a>, etc.), but to the first-fruits (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-12.htm">Leviticus 2:12</a>), and dedicatory offerings, which were presented to the Lord for His sanctuary and His service without being laid upon the altar (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/7-3.htm">Numbers 7:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-10.htm">Numbers 7:10</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-50.htm">Numbers 31:50</a>). The word is only used in Leviticus and Numbers, and two passages in Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-28.htm">Ezekiel 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-43.htm">Ezekiel 40:43</a>), where it is taken from the books of Moses, and is invariably rendered &#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; in the lxx (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-11.htm">Mark 7:11</a> "Corban, that is to say a gift"). &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492; &#1502;&#1503; (from the cattle) belongs to the first clause, though it is separated from it by the Athnach; and the apodosis begins with &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; &#1502;&#1503; (from the herd). The actual antithesis to "the cattle" is "the fowl" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-14.htm">Leviticus 1:14</a>; though grammatically the latter is connected with <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-10.htm">Leviticus 1:10</a>, rather than <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-2.htm">Leviticus 1:2</a>. The fowls (pigeons) cannot be included in the behemah, for this is used to denote, not domesticated animals generally, but the larger domesticated quadrupeds, or tame cattle (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-25.htm">Genesis 1:25</a>). </body></html>
