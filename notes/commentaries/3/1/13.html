Those creatures were chosen for sacrifice which were mild, and gentle, and harmless; to show the innocence and meekness that were in Christ, and that should be in Christians. The offering of the poor was as typical of Christ's atonement as the more costly sacrifices, and expressed as fully repentance, faith, and devotedness to God. We have no excuse, if we refuse the pleasant and reasonable service now required. But we can no more offer the sacrifice of a broken heart, or of praise and thanksgiving, than an Israelite could offer a bullock or a goat, except as God hath first given to us. The more we do in the Lord's service, the greater are our obligations to him, for the will, for the ability, and opportunity. In many things God leaves us to fix what shall be spent in his service, whether of our time or our substance; yet where God's providence has put much into a man's power, scanty offerings will not be accepted, for they are not proper expressions of a willing mind. Let us be devoted in body and soul to his service, whatever he may call us to give, venture, do, or suffer for his sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Northward before the Lord - That is, on the north side of the altar.

To this end they were to "put fire upon the altar" (of course this only applies to the first burnt-offering presented after the erection of the altar, as the fire was to be constantly burning upon the altar after that, without being allowed to go out, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-6.htm">Leviticus 6:6</a>), and to lay "wood in order upon the fire" (&#1506;&#1512;&#1498; to lay in regular order), and then to "lay the parts, the head and the fat, in order upon the wood on the fire," and thus to cause the whole to ascend in smoke. &#1508;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;, which is only used in connection with the burnt-offering (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-8.htm">Leviticus 1:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-12.htm">Leviticus 1:12</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-20.htm">Leviticus 8:20</a>), signifies, according to the ancient versions (lxx &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;) and the rabbinical writers, the fat, probably those portions of fat which were separated from the entrails and taken out to wash. Bochart's explanation is adeps a carne sejunctus. The head and fat are specially mentioned along with the pieces of flesh, partly because they are both separated from the flesh when animals are slaughtered, and partly also to point out distinctly that the whole of the animal ("all," <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>) was to be burned upon the altar, with the exception of the skin, which was given to the officiating priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-8.htm">Leviticus 7:8</a>), and the contents of the intestines. &#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;&#1512;, to cause to ascend in smoke and steam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7</a>), which is frequently construed with &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; towards the altar (&#1492; local, so used as to include position in a place; vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-13.htm">Leviticus 1:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-15.htm">Leviticus 1:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-17.htm">Leviticus 1:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-2.htm">Leviticus 2:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-9.htm">Leviticus 2:9</a>, etc.), or with &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-8.htm">Leviticus 6:8</a>), or &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-13.htm">Leviticus 9:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-17.htm">Leviticus 9:17</a>), was the technical expression for burning the sacrifice upon the altar, and showed that the intention was not simply to burn those portions of the sacrifice which were placed in the fire, i.e., to destroy, or turn them into ashes, but by this process of burning to cause the odour which was eliminated to ascend to heaven as the ethereal essence of the sacrifice, for a "firing of a sweet savour unto Jehovah." &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492;, firing ("an offering made by fire," Eng. Ver.), is the general expression used to denote the sacrifices, which ascended in fire upon the altar, whether animal or vegetable (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-2.htm">Leviticus 2:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-11.htm">Leviticus 2:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-16.htm">Leviticus 2:16</a>), and is also applied to the incense laid upon the shew-bread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-7.htm">Leviticus 24:7</a>); and hence the shew-bread itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-7.htm">Leviticus 24:7</a>), and even those portions of the sacrifices which Jehovah assigned to the priests for them to eat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1</a> cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-14.htm">Joshua 13:14</a>), came also to be included in the firings for Jehovah. The word does not occur out of the Pentateuch, except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-14.htm">Joshua 13:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-28.htm">1 Samuel 2:28</a>. In the laws of sacrifice it is generally associated with the expression, "a sweet savour unto Jehovah" (&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;: lxx): an anthropomorphic description of the divine satisfaction with the sacrifices offered, or the gracious acceptance of them on the part of God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>), which is used in connection with all the sacrifices, even the expiatory or sin-offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-31.htm">Leviticus 4:31</a>), and with the drink-offering also (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-7.htm">Numbers 15:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-10.htm">Numbers 15:10</a>). </body></html>
