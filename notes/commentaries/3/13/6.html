Christ is said to cleanse lepers, not to cure them. Common as the leprosy was among the Hebrews, during and after their residence in Egypt, we have no reason to believe that it was known among them before. Their distressed state and employment in that land must have rendered them liable to disease. But it was a plague often inflicted immediately by the hand of God. Miriam's leprosy, and Gehazi's, and king Uzziah's, were punishments of particular sins; no marvel there was care taken to distinguish it from a common distemper. The judgment of it was referred to the priests. And it was a figure of the moral pollutions of men's minds by sin, which is the leprosy of the soul, defiling to the conscience, and from which Christ alone can cleanse. The priest could only convict the leper, (by the law is the knowledge of sin,) but Christ can cure the sinner, he can take away sin. It is a work of great importance, but of great difficulty, to judge of our spiritual state. We all have cause to suspect ourselves, being conscious of sores and spots; but whether clean or unclean is the question. As there were certain marks by which to know it was leprosy, so there are marks of such as are in the gall of bitterness. The priest must take time in making his judgment. This teaches all, both ministers and people, not to be hasty in censures, nor to judge anything before the time. If some men's sins go before unto judgment, the sins of others follow after, and so do men's good works. If the person suspected were found to be clean, yet he must wash his clothes, because there had been ground for the suspicion. We have need to be washed in the blood of Christ from our spots, though not leprosy spots; for who can say, I am pure from sin?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Somewhat dark - Rather, somewhat dim: that is, if the spot is dying away. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-6. the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh, &c.&#8212;The leprosy, as covering the person with a white, scaly scurf, has always been accounted an offensive blemish rather than a serious malady in the East, unless when it assumed its less common and malignant forms. When a Hebrew priest, after a careful inspection, discovered under the cutaneous blemish the distinctive signs of contagious leprosy, the person was immediately pronounced unclean, and is supposed to have been sent out of the camp to a lazaretto provided for that purpose. If the symptoms appeared to be doubtful, he ordered the person to be kept in domestic confinement for seven days, when he was subjected to a second examination; and if during the previous week the eruption had subsided or appeared to be harmless, he was instantly discharged. But if the eruption continued unabated and still doubtful, he was put under surveillance another week; at the end of which the character of the disorder never failed to manifest itself, and he was either doomed to perpetual exclusion from society or allowed to go at large. A person who had thus been detained on suspicion, when at length set at liberty, was obliged to "wash his clothes," as having been tainted by ceremonial pollution; and the purification through which he was required to go was, in the spirit of the Mosaic dispensation, symbolical of that inward purity it was instituted to promote.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">If the plague be somewhat dark; </span> which is opposed to the white colour of the leprosy.

On the second seventh day, at the end of a fortnight from his being first presented to him, and shut up: <p>and, behold, if the plague be somewhat dark; the spot be not so bright, or so white as it was at first; though Aben Ezra observes, that indeed many wise men say, that is as  signifying dark, and the testimony or proof they bring is <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-1.htm">Genesis 27:1</a> but according to my opinion, adds he, the word is the reverse of  to spread; and the sense is, if the plague does not spread itself in another place; and so some translators render it "contracted", or "contracts itself" (h): and this seems best to agree with what follows: <p>and the plague spread not in the skin; but is as it was when first viewed, after waiting fourteen days, and making observations on it: <p>the priest shall pronounce him clean; that is, from leprosy, otherwise there was an impure disorder on him, a scabious one: <p>it is but a scab; which is the name, Jarchi says, of a clean plague or stroke, that is, in comparison of the leprosy, otherwise such cannot be said with any propriety to be clean. Ben Gersom better explains it, it is a white scab, but not of the kind of leprosy, although it is found as the whiteness of the bright spot; but there are not seen in it the signs of leprosy, the hair is not turned white, nor has the plague increased: <p>and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean; for seeing he was obliged to be shut up, as Jarchi observes, he is called unclean, and stood in need of dipping, that is, his body and his clothes into water; so the people of God, though they are justified by the righteousness of Christ, and are pronounced clean through it, yet since they have their spots and scabs, they have need to have their conversation garments continually washed in the blood of the Lamb. <p>(h) "contracta est", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; "contraxerit sese", some in Vatablus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, <i>if</i> the plague <i>be</i> somewhat <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> dark, <i>and</i> the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it <i>is but</i> a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.</span><p>(c) As having the skin drawn together, or blackish.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the expiration of the days of her purification "with regard to a son or a daughter," i.e., according as she had given birth to a son or a daughter (not for the son or daughter, for the woman needed purification for herself, and not for the child to which she had given birth, and it was the woman, not the child, that was unclean), she was to bring to the priest a yearling lamb for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon or turtle-dove for a sin-offering, that he might make atonement for her before Jehovah and she might become clean from the course of her issue. &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;, lit., son of his year, which is a year old (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-12.htm">Leviticus 23:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-12.htm">Numbers 6:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-14.htm">Numbers 6:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/7-15.htm">Numbers 7:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/7-21.htm">Numbers 7:21</a>, etc.), is used interchangeably with &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>), and with &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; in the plural (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-18.htm">Leviticus 23:18-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/7-17.htm">Numbers 7:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/7-23.htm">Numbers 7:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-29.htm">Numbers 7:29</a>). &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;, fountain of bleeding (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>), equivalent to hemorrhage (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-18.htm">Leviticus 20:18</a>). The purification by bathing and washing is not specially mentioned, as being a matter of course; nor is anything stated with reference to the communication of her uncleanness to persons who touched either her or her couch, since the instructions with regard to the period of menstruation no doubt applied to the first seven and fourteen days respectively. For her restoration to the Lord and His sanctuary, she was to come and be cleansed with a sin-offering and a burnt-offering, on account of the uncleanness in which the sin of nature had manifested itself; because she had been obliged to absent herself in consequence for a whole week from the sanctuary and fellowship of the Lord. But as this purification had reference, not to any special moral guilt, but only to sin which had been indirectly manifested in her bodily condition, a pigeon was sufficient for the sin-offering, that is to say, the smallest of the bleeding sacrifices; whereas a yearling lamb was required for a burnt-offering, to express the importance and strength of her surrender of herself to the Lord after so long a separation from Him. But in cases of great poverty a pigeon might be substituted for the lamb (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-8.htm">Leviticus 12:8</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-7.htm">Leviticus 5:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-11.htm">Leviticus 5:11</a>). </body></html>
