(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-10.htm" title="And he that is the high priest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;">Leviticus 21:10</a>.) During the second Temple the administrators of the law exempted leprous women from rending their clothes, which was evidently owing to a feeling of decorum.<p><span class= "bld">And his head bare.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">and his hair be dishevelled. </span>This was another sign of mourning. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm" title="And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest you die, and lest wrath come on all the people: but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, mourn the burning which the LORD has kindled.">Leviticus 10:6</a>.) The legislators during the second Temple also exempted leprous women from letting their hair fall in the disorderly and wild manner over their heads and faces which was the custom for mourners to do.<p><span class= "bld">And he shall put a covering upon his upper lip.</span>—To veil the beard, which was the pride of the Oriental, was also a sign of mourning. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-17.htm" title="Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of your head on you, and put on your shoes on your feet, and cover not your lips, and eat not the bread of men.">Ezekiel 24:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-22.htm" title="And you shall do as I have done: you shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.">Ezekiel 24:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-7.htm" title="Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yes, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.">Micah 3:7</a>.) This was generally done by throwing the skirt of the garment over the lower part of the chin.<p><span class= "bld">And shall cry, Unclean.</span>—As leprosy was most defiling, and as the very entrance of a leper into a house rendered everything in it unclean, the person thus afflicted had to warn off the passers by, lest they should approach him, and by contact with him become defiled. In some instances this was done by a herald, who preceded the leper. Hence the rendering of the ancient Chaldee paraphrase of Jonathan by “a herald shall proclaim, and say, Depart, depart from the unclean !”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-45.htm" title="And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bore, and he shall put a covering on his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.">Leviticus 13:45</a></span>. <span class="ital">His clothes shall be rent — </span>Whatever Israelite was found and declared by the priest to be a leper, was to be in the condition of a mourner, and in all respects to behave as such, that he might sensibly declare his afflicted state. 1st, His clothes were to be rent in the upper and fore parts, which were most visible, and this partly as a token of his sorrow, because, though his disorder was not a sin, yet it was an effect of sin, and a sore punishment whereby he was cut off, both from converse with men, and from the enjoyment of God in his ordinances; and partly as a warning to others to keep at a due distance from him wheresoever he came. 2d, <span class="ital">His head </span>was to be bare, which was another sign of mourning. God would have men, although not overwhelmed with, yet deeply sensible of his judgments. 3d, He was to cover his upper lip, either, perhaps, with his hand, or with the skirt of his garment, partly as a badge of his sorrow, and shame, (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/24-17.htm" title="Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of your head on you, and put on your shoes on your feet, and cover not your lips, and eat not the bread of men....">Ezekiel 24:17-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-7.htm" title="Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yes, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.">Micah 3:7</a>,) and partly for the preservation of others from his breath or touch. According to the Hebrew doctors, by covering the lip was implied, that the leper was not to salute any man all the days of his uncleanness. 4th, He was to cry, <span class="ital">unclean, unclean. </span>As begging the pity and prayers of others, and confessing his own infirmity, and cautioning those that came near him to keep at a distance from him. To this Jeremiah alludes, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-15.htm" title="They cried to them, Depart you; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn there.">Lamentations 4:15</a>,) <span class="ital">They cried unto them, Depart ye: it is unclean: depart, depart, touch not.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:45,46 When the priest had pronounced the leper unclean, it put a stop to his business in the world, cut him off from his friends and relations, and ruined all the comfort he could have in the world. He must humble himself under the mighty hand of God, not insisting upon his cleanness, when the priest had pronounced him unclean, but accepting the punishment. Thus must we take to ourselves the shame that belongs to us, and with broken hearts call ourselves Unclean, unclean; heart unclean, life unclean; unclean by original corruption, unclean by actual transgression; unclean, therefore deserving to be for ever shut out from communion with God, and all hope of happiness in him; unclean, therefore undone, if infinite mercy do not interpose. The leper must warn others to take heed of coming near him. He must then be shut out of the camp, and afterward, when they came to Canaan, be shut out of the city, town, or village where he lived, and dwell with none but those that were lepers like himself. This typified the purity which ought to be in the gospel church.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The leper was to carry about with him the usual signs of mourning for the dead.

Rending garments and uncovering the head were common signs of mourning. As to "the putting a covering upon the upper lip," that means either wearing a moustache, as the Hebrews used to shave the upper lip [Calmet], or simply keeping a hand over it.

Meaning not he only that has the plague of leprosy in his head, but every sort of leper before mentioned in this chapter: <p>his clothes shall be rent; not that he might the more easily put on his clothes without hurting him, as some have thought; or that the corrupt humours might evaporate more freely, for evaporation would rather be hindered than promoted by being exposed to cold; nor that he might be known and better avoided, for his cry after mentioned was sufficient for that; but as a token of mourning: and so Aben Ezra having mentioned the former reason, that he might be known by going in a different habit, adds, or the sense is, as a token of mourning; for he was to mourn for the wickedness of his actions; for, for his works came this plague of leprosy upon him; and so the Jews in common understand it, not as a disease arising from natural causes, but as a punishment inflicted by God for sin; wherefore this rite of rending the garments was an emblem of contrition of heart, and of sorrow and humiliation for sin, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/1-13.htm">Joel 1:13</a>, <p>and his head bare; or "free" from cutting or shaving, but shall let his hair grow; and so the Targum of Jonathan and Jarchi interpret it; or free from any covering upon it, hat, or cap, or turban: Ben Gersom observes, that the making bare the head, or freeing it, is taken different ways; sometimes it is used of not shaving the head for thirty days, and sometimes for the removal of the vail, or covering of the head it has been used to; but in this place it cannot signify the nourishing of the hair, but that his head ought to be covered: and so Maimonides (a) observes, that a leper should cover his head all the days he is excluded, and this was a token of mourning also; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>, <p>and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip; as a mourner, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17</a>. Jarchi interprets it of both lips, upper and under, which were covered with a linen cloth or vail thrown over the shoulder, and with which the mouth was covered; and this was done, as Aben Ezra says, that the leper might not hurt any with the breath of his mouth: <p>and shall cry, Unclean, unclean; as he passed along in any public place, that everyone might avoid him, and not be polluted by him: the Targum of Jonathan is,"a herald shall proclaim and say, Depart, depart from the unclean.''So every sinner sensible of the leprosy of sin in his nature, and which appears in his actions, should freely confess and acknowledge his uncleanness, original and actual, the impurity of his heart and life, and even of his own righteousness in the sight of God, and have recourse to Christ, and to his blood, for the cleansing him from it. <p>(a) Hilchot Tumaat Tzarat, c. 10. sect. 6. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the leper in whom the plague <i>is</i>, his clothes shall be <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.</span><p>(m) In sign of sorrow and lamentation.<p>(n) Either in token of mourning, or for fear of infecting others.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/leviticus/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">45</span>. <span class="ital">his clothes shall be rent</span>] not the usual Heb. word, but one used only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm" title="And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest you die, and lest wrath come on all the people: but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, mourn the burning which the LORD has kindled.">Leviticus 10:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-10.htm" title="And he that is the high priest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;">Leviticus 21:10</a>; Jewish tradition exempted women from rending their clothes.

By the expression, He shall dwell alone, is meant he shall dwell apart from those who were clean. Of course, lepers would naturally associate with each other, and so we find that they actually did (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-12.htm">Luke 17:12</a>). As their presence was supposed to defile any place that they entered, they were punished in later times with forty stripes if they did not observe the restraints laid down for them. "They were, however, admitted to the synagogue, where a place was railed off for them, ten handbreadths high and four cubits wide, on condition of their entering the house of worship before the rest of the congregation and leaving it after them" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service'). The exclusion of the leper was not for the purpose of avoiding contagion, nor to serve as a penalty for having contracted so loathsome a disease, but primarily to prevent the spread of ceremonial uncleanness communicated by his touch, and typically and mystically to teach that the fate brought upon a man by unremoved sin is separation from the people of God here and hereafter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Harmless leprosy. - This broke out upon the skin of the body in &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1514; plaits, "white rings."
