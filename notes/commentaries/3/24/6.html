Like all the sacred furniture, except the Ark of the Covenant, it was ranged lengthways of the sanctuary. It was one cubit and a half, or nine handbreadths high; the surface board or plate was two cubits, or twelve handbreadths long, and one cubit or six handbreadths broad. These twelve cakes were placed one upon another in two piles lengthwise on the breadth of the table. As the cakes were ten handbreadths long, and the table was only six handbreadths wide, the cakes projected two hand breadths at each side of the table.<p><span class= "bld">Upon the pure table.</span>—According to the interpretation which obtained during the second Temple, this denotes that the cakes are to be put upon the table itself, and not upon the hollow golden rods which were on the table to allow the air to pass through to prevent the shewbread becoming mouldy during the week. These hollow tubes are to be placed between the cakes, whilst the cakes themselves are to be put on the table itself and not on the tubes, so as to be raised above the table.<p><span class= "bld">Before the Lord.</span>—That is, the table which stood before the Lord, for it was placed in the sanctuary. The cakes, therefore, which were thus ranged upon it were constantly before God. Hence, not only is the table called “the table of His Presence” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-7.htm" title="And on the table of show bread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers to cover with: and the continual bread shall be thereon:">Numbers 4:7</a>), but the cakes are called “the bread of His Presence” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-30.htm" title="And you shall set on the table show bread before me always.">Exodus 25:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-13.htm" title="The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the show bread,">Exodus 35:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-36.htm" title="The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the show bread,">Exodus 39:36</a>). The rendering of the Authorised Version, “table of shewbread,” and “shewbread,” is taken from Luther, and does not express the import of the names. The names, “the bread set in order,” “the sets of bread,” and the “table set in order,” which were given to the cakes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-32.htm" title="And other of their brothers, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over the show bread, to prepare it every sabbath.">1Chronicles 9:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-29.htm" title="Both for the show bread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;">1Chronicles 23:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-11.htm" title="And they burn to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the show bread also set they in order on the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but you have forsaken him.">2Chronicles 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-33.htm" title="For the show bread, and for the continual meat offering, and for the continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God.">Nehemiah 10:33</a>) and to the table (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-18.htm" title="Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the show bread table, with all the vessels thereof.">2Chronicles 29:18</a>) in later times, and which are unjustifiably obliterated in the Authorised Version, are derived from this verse where the cakes are ordered to be ranged in two “sets.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/24.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/24-6.htm" title="And you shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure table before the LORD....">Leviticus 24:6-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">In two rows — </span>One piled above another; and on the top of each row was set a golden dish, with a handful of the best frankincense therein. <span class="ital">On the bread for a memorial — </span>That is, in order to be burned upon the altar at the week’s end, instead of the bread, in honour of God, or to commemorate his name.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:1-9 The loaves of bread typify Christ as the Bread of life, and the food of the souls of his people.

Every Sabbath a fresh supply was furnished; hot loaves were placed on the altar instead of the stale ones, which, having lain a week, were removed, and eaten only by the priests, except in cases of necessity (1Sa 21:3-6; also Lu 6:3, 4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Not one above another, but one beside another, as the frankincense put upon each, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-7.htm" title="And you shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to the LORD.">Leviticus 24:7</a></span>, shows.
