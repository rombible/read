The vacant place in question may, therefore, (1) have been divided between the two ends of the table, and a bowl with incense been put at each end on either side of the two piles; or (2) the disposable vacant space may have been left at one end of the table only, and the bowls put together on this end by one side of the two piles; or (3) each of the two piles of the cakes may have been put more or less closely to the other end of the table, thus leaving a vacant space between the two piles, into which the two bowls with the frankincense were placed.

The introductory formula, "Command the children of Israel that they fetch (bring)," shows that the command relates to an offering on the part of the congregation, a sacrificial gift, with which Israel was to serve the Lord continually. This service consisted in the fact, that in the oil of the lamps of the seven-branched candlestick, which burned before Jehovah, the nation of Israel manifested itself as a congregation which caused its light to shine in the darkness of this world; and that in the shew-bread it offered the fruits of its labour in the field of the kingdom of God, as a spiritual sacrifice to Jehovah. The offering of oil, therefore, for the preparation of the candlestick, and that of fine flour for making the loaves to be placed before Jehovah, formed part of the service in which Israel sanctified its life and labour to the Lord its God, not only at the appointed festal periods, but every day; and the law is very appropriately appended to the sanctification of the Sabbaths and feast-days, prescribed in ch. 23. The first instructions in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-2.htm">Leviticus 24:2-4</a> are a verbal repetition of <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20-21</a>, and have been explained already. Their execution by Aaron is recorded at <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-1.htm">Numbers 8:1-4</a>; and the candlestick itself was set in order by Moses at the consecration of the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-25.htm">Exodus 40:25</a>). </body></html>
