She had married an Egyptian whilst she and her people were still in Egypt. Though the father’s nationality is here expressly given, yet from the fact that he does not personally come before us in this incident, it is evident that he remained in Egypt, whilst the son was of the “mixed multitude” who followed the Israelites in their exodus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-38.htm" title="And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.">Exodus 12:38</a>). This incident, therefore, which is so difficult satisfactorily to connect with the preceding legislation, brings before us a picture of the camp-life of the Israelites in the wilderness. According to tradition, the father of this blasphemer was the taskmaster under whom Shelomith’s husband worked in Egypt, that he had injured Shelomith and then smote her husband, that this was the Egyptian whom Moses slew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-11.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brothers, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brothers.">Exodus 2:11</a>) for the injuries he had thus inflicted both upon the Hebrew and his wife, and that the culprit before us is the issue of the outraged Shelomith by the slain Egyptian. This will explain the rendering here of the ancient Chaldee version, “A wicked man, a rebel against the God of heaven, had come out of Egypt, the son of the Egyptian who slew an Israelite in Egypt, and outraged his wife, who conceived, and brought forth this son among the children of Israel.”<p><span class= "bld">Went out among the children of Israel.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">he went out into the midst, </span>&c. This shows that he lived outside the camp and came where he had no right to be.<p><span class= "bld">This son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together.</span>—The cause and the manner of their quarrel or contention are not given. But. according to tradition, the “man of Israel” was a Danite, and, as we are told in the next verse, his mother was of the tribe of Dan, this semi-Egyptian contended with this Danite that he had a right from the side of his mother to encamp among the children of Dan, whilst the Danite disputed this, maintaining that a son could only pitch his tent by the standard of his father’s name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-2.htm" title="Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, with the ensign of their father's house: far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch.">Numbers 2:2</a>). This contention, moreover, took place before the rulers who tried the case (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/19-21.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.">Exodus 19:21-22</a>). Hence the ancient Chaldee version translates it, “And while the Israelites were dwelling in the wilderness, he sought to pitch his tent in the midst of the tribe of the children of Dan; but they would not let him, because, according to the order of Israel, every man, according to his order, dwelt with his family by the ensign of his father’s house. And they strove together in the camp. Whereupon the son of the Israelitish woman and the man of Israel who was of the tribe of Dan went into the house of judgment.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/24.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-10.htm" title="And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;">Leviticus 24:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">Whose father was an Egyptian — </span>This circumstance seems noted, partly to show the danger of marriages with persons of wicked principles, and partly by this severity against him who was a stranger by the father, and an Israelite by the mother, to show that God would not have this sin go unpunished among his people, whatsoever he was that committed it. <span class="ital">Went out </span>— Out of Egypt, being one of that mixed multitude which came out with the Israelites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-32.htm" title="Also take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also.">Exodus 12:32</a>.

The notice of his parents shows the common ill effect of mixed marriages. A standing law for the stoning of blasphemers was made upon this occasion. Great stress is laid upon this law. It extends to the strangers among them, as well as to those born in the land. Strangers, as well as native Israelites, should be entitled to the benefit of the law, so as not to suffer wrong; and should be liable to the penalty of this law, in case they did wrong. If those who profane the name of God escape punishment from men, yet the Lord our God will not suffer them to escape his righteous judgments. What enmity against God must be in the heart of man, when blasphemies against God proceed out of his mouth. If he that despised Moses' law, died without mercy, of what punishment will they be worthy, who despise and abuse the gospel of the Son of God! Let us watch against anger, do no evil, avoid all connexions with wicked people, and reverence that holy name which sinners blaspheme.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a> note.

The "mixed multitude" [Ex 12:38] that accompanied the Israelites in their exodus from Egypt creates a presumption that marriage connections of the kind described were not infrequent. And it was most natural, in the relative circumstances of the two people, that the father should be an Egyptian and the mother an Israelite.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Whose father was an Egyptian:</span> this circumstance seems noted, partly to show the danger of marriages with persons of wicked principles or practices, wherein the children, as one wittily and truly observes, like the conclusion, do commonly follow the worse part, and are more easily taught by word or example to do ten things agreeable to their corrupt natures, than one thing contrary to it; and partly by this severity against him who was a stranger by the father, and an Israelite by the mother, to show that God would not have this sin to go unpunished amongst his people, whatsoever he was that committed it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Went out, </span> to wit, out of Egypt, being one of that mixed multitude which came out with the Israelites, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-38.htm" title="And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.">Exodus 12:38</a></span>.

He seems to have committed two offenses which led up to his great crime. First, he <span class="cmt_word">went out among the children of Israel</span>, that is, he did not confine himself to his own part of the encampment, where the mixed multitude lived, but he intruded into the part set aside for pure Israelites; <span class="cmt_word">and next, having thus put himself already in the wrong, this</span> son of the Israelitish woman <span class="cmt_word">and a man of Israel strove together in the camp.</span> According to Jewish tradition, the cause of quarrel was a claim set up by the Egypto-Israelite to encamp in the Danite quarters, on the ground that his mother was a Danite - a claim which he insisted on enforcing, although the judges gave a decision against him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The directions concerning the oil for the holy candlestick (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-1.htm">Leviticus 24:1-4</a>) and the preparation of the shew-bread (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>) lose the appearance of an interpolation, when we consider and rightly understand on the one hand the manner in which the two are introduced in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-2.htm">Leviticus 24:2</a>, and on the other their significance in relation to the worship of God. The introductory formula, "Command the children of Israel that they fetch (bring)," shows that the command relates to an offering on the part of the congregation, a sacrificial gift, with which Israel was to serve the Lord continually. This service consisted in the fact, that in the oil of the lamps of the seven-branched candlestick, which burned before Jehovah, the nation of Israel manifested itself as a congregation which caused its light to shine in the darkness of this world; and that in the shew-bread it offered the fruits of its labour in the field of the kingdom of God, as a spiritual sacrifice to Jehovah. The offering of oil, therefore, for the preparation of the candlestick, and that of fine flour for making the loaves to be placed before Jehovah, formed part of the service in which Israel sanctified its life and labour to the Lord its God, not only at the appointed festal periods, but every day; and the law is very appropriately appended to the sanctification of the Sabbaths and feast-days, prescribed in ch. 23. The first instructions in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-2.htm">Leviticus 24:2-4</a> are a verbal repetition of <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20-21</a>, and have been explained already. Their execution by Aaron is recorded at <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-1.htm">Numbers 8:1-4</a>; and the candlestick itself was set in order by Moses at the consecration of the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-25.htm">Exodus 40:25</a>). </body></html>
