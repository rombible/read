The notice of his parents shows the common ill effect of mixed marriages. A standing law for the stoning of blasphemers was made upon this occasion. Great stress is laid upon this law. It extends to the strangers among them, as well as to those born in the land. Strangers, as well as native Israelites, should be entitled to the benefit of the law, so as not to suffer wrong; and should be liable to the penalty of this law, in case they did wrong. If those who profane the name of God escape punishment from men, yet the Lord our God will not suffer them to escape his righteous judgments. What enmity against God must be in the heart of man, when blasphemies against God proceed out of his mouth. If he that despised Moses' law, died without mercy, of what punishment will they be worthy, who despise and abuse the gospel of the Son of God! Let us watch against anger, do no evil, avoid all connexions with wicked people, and reverence that holy name which sinners blaspheme.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Stranger - i. e. foreigner.

So it was by a judicial or semi-judicial proceeding that St. Stephen was stoned: "They brought him to the council, and set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the Law" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-12.htm">Acts 6:12, 13</a>). And in spite of the violence exhibited, there was still some form of law, according to Jewish practice, observed in his stoning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>). In the case of our Lord, on the other hand. when they regarded him as guilty of blasphemy on his saying, "Before Abraham was, I am" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>), and "I and my Father are one" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>), the Jews "took up stones to cast at him," not waiting for a judicial condemnation, but, as they supposed, taking the law into their own hands. Had his death been by Jewish hands, it would at the last have been by stoning under this law. But the power of life and death had been taken away from the Jews by the Romans, "that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-32.htm">John 18:32</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The decision asked for from God concerning the crime of the blasphemer, who was the son of an Egyptian, and therefore not a member of the congregation of Jehovah, furnished the occasion for God to repeat those laws respecting murder or personal injury inflicted upon a man, which had hitherto been given for the Israelites alone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12</a>.), and to proclaim their validity in the case of the foreigner also (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-17.htm">Leviticus 24:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-21.htm">Leviticus 24:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-22.htm">Leviticus 24:22</a>). To these there are appended the kindred commandments concerning the killing of cattle (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-18.htm">Leviticus 24:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-21.htm">Leviticus 24:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-22.htm">Leviticus 24:22</a>), which had not been given, it is true, expressis verbis, but were contained implicite in the rights of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-33.htm">Exodus 21:33</a>.), and are also extended to foreigners. &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, to smite the soul of a man, i.e., to put him to death; - the expression "soul of a beast," in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-18.htm">Leviticus 24:18</a>, is to be understood in the same sense. </body></html>
