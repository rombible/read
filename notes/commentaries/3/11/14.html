Kites are very plentiful in Syria, and are frequently seen hovering over the plains, the villages, and the outskirts of towns, and looking out for garbage and offal, and hence are often seen in company with the vulture at their useful task of devouring the carrion. Their gregarious habits are referred to by Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-15.htm" title="There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.">Isaiah 34:15</a>), where they are mentioned in company with other raptatores as suitable inhabitants of devastated Edom. The kite is used by different Eastern tribes as food.<p><span class= "bld">And the kite.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">the falcon. </span>“The greedy one” (<span class= "ital">ayah</span>), as it is called in the original, fitly describes this most sagacious, sanguinary, and rapacious robber. Its piercing sight is referred to by Job (28:7), where it is translated <span class= "ital">vulture </span>in the Authorised Version, though in the passage before us and in the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-13.htm" title="And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,">Deuteronomy 14:13</a>, it is rendered <span class= "ital">kite. </span>It exists in Syria in a great variety of species, for which reason the text adds “after his kind.” The falcon is eaten in the Levant, and is considered rather delicate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/11-14.htm" title="And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;...">Leviticus 11:14-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">The vulture and the kite — </span>Known birds of prey. <span class="ital">Every raven — </span>All interpreters agree that the Hebrew word <span class="greekheb">ערב</span>, <span class="ital">gnoreb, </span>signifies <span class="ital">raven, </span>from <span class="ital">gnereb, evening, </span>on account of its colour. <span class="ital">After his kind — </span>Including crows, rooks, pyes. <span class="ital">The owl — </span>The original word, literally <span class="ital">daughter of the echo, </span>signifies a bird which inhabits desolate places, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm" title="But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-32.htm" title="And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.">Jeremiah 50:32</a>, where the same word occurs. This description agrees well to the <span class="ital">owl. </span>It must be observed, however, that there is great uncertainty as to the meaning of several of the Hebrew names here used, the Jews themselves acknowledging the meaning of many of them to be now lost. Add to this that the animals in the eastern countries differ greatly from those of our climate, and for want of a better knowledge of them, it is probable that in giving them the names of such animals as we are acquainted with here, we often greatly err. This consideration might convince the Jews of the absurdity of pretending still to adhere to the law of Moses; since it is evident, in many cases, they know not what is forbidden, and what is not.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-47 What animals were clean and unclean. - These laws seem to have been intended, 1. As a test of the people's obedience, as Adam was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge; and to teach them self-denial, and the government of their appetites. 2. To keep the Israelites distinct from other nations. Many also of these forbidden animals were objects of superstition and idolatry to the heathen. 3. The people were taught to make distinctions between the holy and unholy in their companions and intimate connexions. 4. The law forbad, not only the eating of the unclean beasts, but the touching of them. Those who would be kept from any sin, must be careful to avoid all temptations to it, or coming near it. The exceptions are very minute, and all were designed to call forth constant care and exactness in their obedience; and to teach us to obey. Whilst we enjoy our Christian liberty, and are free from such burdensome observances, we must be careful not to abuse our liberty. For the Lord hath redeemed and called his people, that they may be holy, even as he is holy. We must come out, and be separate from the world; we must leave the company of the ungodly, and all needless connexions with those who are dead in sin; we must be zealous of good works devoted followers of God, and companions of his people.<br>]<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The vulture - Rather, the (black) kite <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-15.htm">Isaiah 34:15</a> : "the kite," rather the red kite, remarkable for its piercing sight <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-7.htm">Job 28:7</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. the vulture&#8212;The word so rendered in our version means more probably "the kite" or "glede" and describes a varying but majestic flight, exactly that of the kite, which now darts forward with the rapidity of an arrow, now rests motionless on its expanded wings in the air.
