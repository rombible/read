The coney, which is the old English name for rabbit, is the meaning of the Hebrew expression <span class= "ital">shaphan, </span>according to the definition of those who had to explain and administer this law at the time of Christ. As these interpreters lived in Palestine, where they saw the animals in question, the objection that the rabbit is not indigenous in Palestine falls to the ground. These shrewd Administrators of the law must also have noticed that it was the habit of the feeble conies to seek refuge and build in the fissures of the rocks, which not unfrequently are on a level with the ground. The rabbit, moreover, well suits the hare, by which it is immediately followed. Modern expositors, however, identify it with the Syrian hyrax, or rock-badger, which is about the size of a well-grown rabbit. It resembles the guinea-pig or the Alpine marmot, has long hair of a brownish grey or brownish-yellow colour on the back, but white on the belly, a very short tail, and short round ears. The action of its jaws when it is at rest resembles that of the ruminants.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-5.htm" title="And the coney, because he chews the cud, but divides not the hoof; he is unclean to you.">Leviticus 11:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">The coney — </span>Hebrews <span class="greekheb">שׁפן</span>, <span class="ital">shapan. </span>It is doubted whether we translate the word right; Bochart takes it to be a large species of rat, somewhat between a coney and a rat, which was common both in Egypt and Palestine.

As a test of the people's obedience, as Adam was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge; and to teach them self-denial, and the government of their appetites. 2. To keep the Israelites distinct from other nations. Many also of these forbidden animals were objects of superstition and idolatry to the heathen. 3. The people were taught to make distinctions between the holy and unholy in their companions and intimate connexions. 4. The law forbad, not only the eating of the unclean beasts, but the touching of them. Those who would be kept from any sin, must be careful to avoid all temptations to it, or coming near it. The exceptions are very minute, and all were designed to call forth constant care and exactness in their obedience; and to teach us to obey. Whilst we enjoy our Christian liberty, and are free from such burdensome observances, we must be careful not to abuse our liberty. For the Lord hath redeemed and called his people, that they may be holy, even as he is holy. We must come out, and be separate from the world; we must leave the company of the ungodly, and all needless connexions with those who are dead in sin; we must be zealous of good works devoted followers of God, and companions of his people.<br>]<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The coney - The Old English name for a rabbit.

The rodents were familiarly spoken of as ruminating animals, just as the bat was reckoned among birds because it flies (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-19.htm">Leviticus 11:19</a>), and as whales and their congeners are spoken of as fish, when there is no occasion for scientific accuracy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. the coney&#8212;not the rabbit, for it is not found in Palestine or Arabia, but the hyrax, a little animal of the size and general shape of the rabbit, but differing from it in several essential features. It has no tail, singular, long hairs bristling like thorns among the fur on its back; its feet are bare, its nails flat and round, except those on each inner toe of the hind feet, which are sharp and project like an awl. It does not burrow in the ground but frequents the clefts of rocks.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Some understand by the Hebrew word <span class="ital">shaphan</span>, <span class="ital">a mountain mouse</span>, which were of a much greater size than ordinary mice, and were used by the Arabians for food.

Ewald, 357. Moses rested satisfied with this answer. Aaron acknowledged that the flesh of the sin-offering ought to have been eaten by the priest in this instance (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-19.htm">Leviticus 6:19</a>), and simply adduced, as the reason why this had not been done, the calamity which had befallen his two eldest sons. And this might really be a sufficient reason, as regarded both himself and his remaining sons, why the eating of the sin-offering should be omitted. For the judgment in question was so solemn a warning, as to the sin which still adhered to them even after the presentation of their sin-offering, that they might properly feel "that they had not so strong and overpowering a holiness as was required for eating the general sin-offering" (M. Baumgarten). This is the correct view, though others find the reason in their grief at the death of their sons or brethren, which rendered it impossible to observe a joyous sacrificial meal. But this is not for a moment to be thought of, simply because the eating of the flesh of the sin-offering was not a joyous meal at all (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-19.htm">Leviticus 6:19</a>).<p>(Note: Upon this mistaken view of the excuse furnished by Aaron, Knobel has founded his assertion, that "this section did not emanate from the Elohist, because he could not have written in this way," an assertion which falls to the ground when the words are correctly explained.) </body></html>
