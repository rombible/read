This signal act of redemption is repeatedly appealed to in the Scriptures, both to show the obligations which the Israelites are under to obey God’s commandments and to expose their ingratitude (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-14.htm" title="Then your heart be lifted up, and you forget the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;">Deuteronomy 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-6.htm" title="If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend, which is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known, you, nor your fathers;">Deuteronomy 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-1.htm" title="When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see horses, and chariots, and a people more than you, be not afraid of them: for the LORD your God is with you, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.">Deuteronomy 20:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-17.htm" title="For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:">Joshua 24:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-12.htm" title="And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves to them, and provoked the LORD to anger.">Judges 2:12</a>, &c.).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-45.htm" title="For I am the LORD that brings you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: you shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.">Leviticus 11:45</a></span>. <span class="ital">That bringeth you up out of Egypt — </span>This was a reason why they should cheerfully submit to distinguishing laws, who had been so honoured with distinguishing favours.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-47 What animals were clean and unclean. - These laws seem to have been intended, 1. As a test of the people's obedience, as Adam was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge; and to teach them self-denial, and the government of their appetites. 2. To keep the Israelites distinct from other nations. Many also of these forbidden animals were objects of superstition and idolatry to the heathen. 3. The people were taught to make distinctions between the holy and unholy in their companions and intimate connexions. 4. The law forbad, not only the eating of the unclean beasts, but the touching of them. Those who would be kept from any sin, must be careful to avoid all temptations to it, or coming near it. The exceptions are very minute, and all were designed to call forth constant care and exactness in their obedience; and to teach us to obey. Whilst we enjoy our Christian liberty, and are free from such burdensome observances, we must be careful not to abuse our liberty. For the Lord hath redeemed and called his people, that they may be holy, even as he is holy. We must come out, and be separate from the world; we must leave the company of the ungodly, and all needless connexions with those who are dead in sin; we must be zealous of good works devoted followers of God, and companions of his people.<br>]<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses set forth the spiritual ground on which the distinction between clean and unclean is based.

It was to he something in their daily life to remind them of the covenant which distinguished them from the nations of the world. By Jesus Christ it was revealed <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-11.htm">Matthew 15:11</a> to the elect people that they were no longer to he tied by the letter of the Law in regard to their food, but were to be left to the exercise of a regenerated judgment.

Nevertheless they were extremely useful and salutary, especially as enforcing attention to cleanliness. This is a matter of essential importance in the East, where venomous reptiles often creep into houses and are found lurking in boxes, vessels, or holes in the wall; and the carcass of one of them, or a dead mouse, mole, lizard, or other unclean animal, might be inadvertently touched by the hand, or fall on clothes, skin bottles, or any article of common domestic use. By connecting, therefore, the touch of such creatures with ceremonial defilement, which required immediately to be removed, an effectual means was taken to prevent the bad effects of venom and all unclean or noxious matter.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For I am the Lord that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt,....
