It occurs no less than twenty-four times, and is in four instances wrongly rendered in the Authorised Version by “grasshopper” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-5.htm" title="For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.">Judges 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-12.htm" title="And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-20.htm" title="Can you make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.">Job 39:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-23.htm" title="They shall cut down her forest, said the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable.">Jeremiah 46:23</a>). It is the locust which constituted the eighth plague of Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/10-4.htm" title="Else, if you refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into your coast:">Exodus 10:4-19</a>); which is described as committing the terrible ravages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-38.htm" title="You shall carry much seed out into the field, and shall gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it.">Deuteronomy 28:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-4.htm" title="That which the palmerworm has left has the locust eaten; and that which the locust has left has the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm has left has the caterpillar eaten.">Joel 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-25.htm" title="And I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.">Joel 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-7.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that all they that look on you shall flee from you, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? from where shall I seek comforters for you?">Nahum 3:7</a>); and which swarmed in such innumerable quantities that it became a proverb in the Bible, “like the locusts in multitude” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-12.htm" title="And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-23.htm" title="They shall cut down her forest, said the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable.">Jeremiah 46:23</a>). From these characteristics the <span class= "ital">arbe </span>is supposed to be the flying migratory locust. The administrators of the law in the time of Christ described the <span class= "ital">arbe </span>by the name <span class= "ital">gubai, </span>which is the species most commonly eaten, and ordained the following benediction to be recited before eating it: “Blessed be He by whose word everything was created.” The locusts which are still eaten by the Jews and other Eastern nations are prepared in different ways. Generally they are thrown alive into a pot of boiling water mixed with salt, and taken out after a few minutes, when the heads, feet, and wings are plucked off, and the trunks are dried in an oven or in the sun on the roofs of houses, and are kept in bags for winter use. They are also broiled or stewed, or fried in butter; or they are mixed with butter and spread on thin cakes of bread. In taste they resemble shrimps or prawns. There are shops in some Eastern towns where they only sell locusts, strung upon cords or by measure. The locusts thus form an antidote to the famine they create by the devastation which they commit. They formed, along with “wild honey,” the food of John the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm" title="And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.">Matthew 3:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And the bald locust.</span>—This is the only place where <span class= "ital">salam, </span>which is the name in the original, occurs as one of the edible kinds of leaping insects. Any attempt to identify the species is simply conjecture, since all which tradition tells us about it is that this kind of locust “has no tail but has a hump.”<p><span class= "bld">The beetle.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">the hopping locust. </span>Though it is difficult to identify the exact species, as the name (<span class= "ital">chargol</span>) does not occur again in the Bible, yet it is perfectly certain that a sort of locust is here intended, since the context clearly shows that four different kinds of the same insect are enumerated. This is moreover confirmed by the administrators of the law in the time of Christ, who assure us the <span class= "ital">chargol </span>is a species of locust having both a hump and a tail, the eggs of which Jewish women suspended in the ear as a remedy against ear-ache. This shows that it must have been a very large kind, and as the name denotes <span class= "ital">the galloping </span>or <span class= "ital">hopping one, </span>it is evidently designed to describe an unwinged species.<p><span class= "bld">The grasshopper.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">the small locust. </span>This name (<span class= "ital">chagab</span>) occurs four times more in the Bible (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-33.htm" title="And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.">Numbers 13:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-13.htm" title="If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;">2Chronicles 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm" title="Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goes to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm" title="It is he that sits on the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretches out the heavens as a curtain, and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in:">Isaiah 40:22</a>), and is only in one place rightly rendered by <span class= "ital">locust </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-13.htm" title="If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;">2Chronicles 7:13</a>) in the Authorised Version. From the fact that it is described as laying waste the fields (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-13.htm" title="If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;">2Chronicles 7:13</a>), and that its insignificant appearance is contrasted with giant men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-33.htm" title="And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.">Numbers 13:33</a>) and with the great God of heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm" title="It is he that sits on the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretches out the heavens as a curtain, and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in:">Isaiah 40:22</a>), it is justly inferred that it denotes a small devastating locust which swarms in great quantities. According to the authorities in the time of Christ, it is a species which has a tail, but no hump. It was so common that the name (<span class= "ital">chagab</span>) became a generic term for many of the locust tribe. Some kinds bearing this name were beautifully marked, and were eagerly caught by Jewish children as playthings, just as butterflies and cockchafers are sought after by children in the present day. Others again were caught in large numbers, sprinkled over with wine, and then sold. Hence the following two rules obtained during the second Temple: (1) No Israelite was allowed to buy them after the dealer had prepared them in this manner; and (2) he that vowed to abstain from flesh is not allowed to eat the flesh of fish and of (<span class= "ital">chagabim</span>) locusts. Because the edible kinds of locusts are passed over in the parallel dietary laws in Deuteronomy, some have concluded that the eating of these insects was prohibited at the more advanced time when Deuteronomy was written. The fact, however, that John the Baptist ate locusts, and that a benediction was ordered during the second Temple to be recited at eating them, plainly shows the futility of the assertion. The Lawgiver never intended to repeat in Deuteronomy every particular point of legislation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-22.htm" title="Even these of them you may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.">Leviticus 11:22</a></span>. <span class="ital">The locust after his kind — </span>The Hebrew word <span class="greekheb">ארבה</span><span class="ital">arbeh, </span>is sometimes a common name for all locusts, but here signifies a peculiar sort of them The name derived from <span class="greekheb">רבה</span><span class="ital">rabah, </span>to multiply, imports a <span class="ital">multitude, </span>no animal being more prolific. <span class="ital">The bald locust — </span>As it is not easy to determine what species of locust this is, and as it has not any name in modern languages, it might be better, in a translation, to retain the original name <span class="greekheb">סלעם</span> <span class="ital">solgnam, </span>which, in the Chaldaic, signifies to <span class="ital">consume. The beetle — </span>As none ever eat beetles, and they are not four-footed <span class="ital">with legs to leap withal, </span>it is the opinion of good critics that the Hebrew word <span class="greekheb">חרגל</span> <span class="ital">chargol </span>is not properly translated. It is rather to be taken for another sort of locust unknown to us. <span class="ital">The grasshopper — </span>Another species of locust, the Hebrew name of which is derived, according to Bochart, from an Arabic word, which signifies <span class="ital">to veil, </span>because they fly in such swarms as sometimes to <span class="ital">veil </span>or <span class="ital">darken </span>the <span class="ital">sun. </span>But how to distinguish these locusts from the rest is difficult, if not impossible to us. They were, however, well known of old in the eastern countries. For locusts, though unusual food with us, were commonly eaten by the Æthiopians, Lybians, Parthians, and other eastern people bordering upon Judea. And as it is certain the eastern locusts were much larger than ours, so it is probable they were of different qualities, and yielded better nourishment.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-47 What animals were clean and unclean. - These laws seem to have been intended, 1. As a test of the people's obedience, as Adam was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge; and to teach them self-denial, and the government of their appetites. 2. To keep the Israelites distinct from other nations. Many also of these forbidden animals were objects of superstition and idolatry to the heathen. 3. The people were taught to make distinctions between the holy and unholy in their companions and intimate connexions. 4. The law forbad, not only the eating of the unclean beasts, but the touching of them. Those who would be kept from any sin, must be careful to avoid all temptations to it, or coming near it. The exceptions are very minute, and all were designed to call forth constant care and exactness in their obedience; and to teach us to obey. Whilst we enjoy our Christian liberty, and are free from such burdensome observances, we must be careful not to abuse our liberty. For the Lord hath redeemed and called his people, that they may be holy, even as he is holy. We must come out, and be separate from the world; we must leave the company of the ungodly, and all needless connexions with those who are dead in sin; we must be zealous of good works devoted followers of God, and companions of his people.<br>]<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the uncertainty of identifying these four creatures, it has been suggested that some of the names may belong to locusts in an imperfect state of development.

They were allowed as lawful food to the Israelites, and they are eaten by the Arabs, who fry them in olive oil.

And it is certain that the eastern locusts were much larger than ours, so it is probable they were of different qualities, and yielded better nourishment; and the familiar use of them made them more agreeable to their bodies; for even poisons themselves have by frequent use been made not only harmless, but nourishing also to some persons. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Even these of them ye may eat, &amp;c. The four following ones, which seem to be no other than four sorts of locusts: <p>the locust after his kind; this is the common locust, called by the name of Arbeh, from the great multiplication and vast multitudes of them; the phrase, "after his kind", and which also is used in all the following instances, signifies the whole entire species of them, which might be eaten: <p>and the bald locust after his kind; which in the Hebrew text is Soleam, and has its name, as Aben Ezra suggests, from its ascending rocks: but since locusts do not climb rocks, or have any peculiar regard for them, rather this kind of locust may be so called, from their devouring and consuming all that come in their way (g), from the Chaldee word  which signifies to swallow, devour, and consume; but why we should call it the bald locust is not so clear, though it seems there were such, since the Jews describe some that have no baldness, which the gloss explains, whose head is not bald (h), which shows that some are bald; and so, this is described by Kimchi (i), it has an eminence, a rising, or bunch upon it; some render it baldness, and it hath no tail, and its head is long; and so Ben Melech: <p>and the beetle after his kind; which is another sort of locust called Chargol, and should not be rendered a beetle, for no sort of beetles are eatable, nor have legs to leap withal, and so come not under the general description given of such flying, creeping things, fit to eat: Kimchi says it is one kind of a locust (k), and Hiscuni derives its name from and  because it strives to leap with its feet, which answers to the above descriptive character: the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions, and some others, render it by Ophiomachus, a fighter with serpents, to which the locust is an enemy, and kills them, taking fast hold of their jaws, as Pliny says (l), and so Aristotle (m): <p>and the grasshopper after his kind; this is another, and the fourth kind of the locust that might be eaten; its name is Chagab, from the Arabic word Chaguba, "to vail", locusts vailing the light of the sun: and according to the Jewish doctors, it is a name which every locust fit to eat should have;"among the locusts (fit for food) are these, who have four feet, and four wings and thighs, and wings covering the greatest part of them, and whose name is Chagab (n);''and commentators say (o), it must be called by this name, as well as have those signs: the difference between these several sorts is with them this; the Chagab has a tail, but no bunch; Arbeh neither bunch nor tail; and Soleam has a bunch, but not a tail; and Chargol has both bunch and tail (p): Maimonides (q) reckons up eight sorts of them fit to eat; and these creatures were not only eaten by the Jews, but by several other nations: with the Parthians they were very agreeable and grateful food, as Pliny (r) relates; who also says (s), that some part of the Ethiopians live only upon them all the year, hardened in smoke, and with salt: Diodorus Siculus (t) makes mention of the same, and calls them Acridophagi, locust eaters, and gives a particular account of their hunting and taking them, and preserving them for food; and so does Strabo (u); and the same Solinus (w) relates of those that border on Mauritania; and they are still eaten in Barbary, where they dry them in ovens to preserve them, and then either eat them alone, or pounded and mixed with milk: their taste is said to be like shrimps (x); and Bochart (y) has shown, from various writers, that they were a delicious food with the Greeks, especially among the common people; and so they are with the Indians (z). <p>(g) So R.

It does not devour carrion indeed, but it eats vegetable matter of the most various kinds, and swallows greedily stones, metals, and even glass. It is found in Arabia, and sometimes in Hauran and Belka (Seetzen and Burckhardt), and has been used as food not only by the Struthiophagi of Ethiopia (Diod. Sic. 3, 27; Strabo, xvi. 772) and Numidia (Leo Afric. p. 766), but by some of the Arabs also (Seetzen, iii. p. 20; Burckhardt, p. 178), whilst others only eat the eggs, and make use of the fat in the preparation of food. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1505;, according to Bochart, Gesenius, and others, is the male ostrich; but this is very improbable. According to the lxx, Vulg., and others, it is the owl (Oedmann, iii. pp. 45ff.); but this is mentioned later under another name. According to Saad. Ar. Erp. it is the swallow; but this is called &#1505;&#1497;&#1505; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7</a>. Knobel supposes it to be the cuckoo, which is met with in Palestine (Seetzen, 1, p. 78), and derives the name from &#1495;&#1502;&#1505;, violenter egit, supposing it to be so called from the violence with which it is said to turn out or devour the eggs and young of other birds, for the purpose of laying its own eggs in the nest (Aristot. hist. an. 6, 7; 9, 29; Ael. nat. an. 6, 7). &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1507; is the &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, or slender gull, according to the lxx and Vulg. Knobel follows the Arabic, however, and supposes it to be a species of hawk, which is trained in Syria for hunting gazelles, hares, etc.; but this is certainly included in the genus &#1504;&#1509;. &#1504;&#1509;, from &#1504;&#1510;&#1509; to fly, is the hawk, which soars very high, and spreads its wings towards the south (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-26.htm">Job 39:26</a>). It stands in fact, as &#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; shows, for the hawk-tribe generally, probably the &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;, accipiter, of which the ancients enumerate many different species. &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505;, which is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-7.htm">Psalm 102:7</a> as dwelling in ruins, is an owl according to the ancient versions, although they differ as to the kind. In Knobel's opinion it is either the screech-owl, which inhabits ruined buildings, walls, and clefts in the rock, and the flesh of which is said to be very agreeable, or the little screech-owl, which also lives in old buildings and walls, and raises a mournful cry at night, and the flesh of which is said to be savoury. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1498;, according to the ancient versions an aquatic bird, and therefore more in place by the side of the heron, where it stands in Deuteronomy, is called by the lxx &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;; in the Targ. and Syr. &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1488; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;, extrahens pisces. It is not the gull, however (larus catarractes), which plunges with violence, for according to Oken this is only seen in the northern seas, but a species of pelican, to be found on the banks of the Nile and in the islands of the Red Sea, which swims well, and also dives, frequently dropping perpendicularly upon fishes in the water. The flesh has an oily taste, but it is eaten for all that.<p>&#1497;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;: from &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507; to snort, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a>, dwelling in ruins, no doubt a species of owl; according to the Chaldee and Syriac, the uhu, which dwells in old ruined towers and castles upon the mountains, and cries uhupuhu. &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1514;, which occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-30.htm">Leviticus 11:30</a> among the names of the lizards, is, according to Damiri, a bird resembling the uhu, but smaller. Jonathan calls it uthya  equals  &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, a night-owl. The primary meaning of the word &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is essentially the same as that of &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507;, to breathe or blow, so called because many of the owls have a mournful cry, and blow and snort in addition; though it cannot be decided whether the strix otus is intended, a bird by no means rare in Egypt, which utters a whistling blast, and rolls itself into a ball and then spreads itself out again, or the strix flammea, a native of Syria, which sometimes utters a mournful cry, and at other times snores like a sleeping man, and the flesh of which is said to be by no means unpleasant, or the hissing owl (strix stridula), which inhabits the ruins in Egypt and Syria, and is sometimes called massusu, at other times bane, a very voracious bird, which is said to fly in at open windows in the evening and kill children that are left unguarded, and which is very much dreaded in consequence. &#1511;&#1488;&#1514;, which also lived in desolate places (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-14.htm">Zephaniah 2:14</a>), or in the desert itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-7.htm">Psalm 102:7</a>), was not the kat, a species of partridge or heath-cock, which is found in Syria (Robinson, ii. p. 620), as this bird always flies in large flocks, and this is not in harmony with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-14.htm">Zephaniah 2:14</a>, but the pelican (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;, lxx), as all the ancient versions render it, which Ephraem (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-17.htm">Numbers 14:17</a>) describes as a marsh-bird, very fond of its young, inhabiting desolate places, and uttering an incessant cry. It is the true pelican of the ancients (pelecanus graculus), the Hebrew name of which seems to have been derived from &#1511;&#1493;&#1488; to spit, from its habit of spitting out the fishes it has caught, and which is found in Palestine and the reedy marshes of Egypt (Robinson, Palestine). &#1512;&#1495;&#1501;, in Deut. &#1512;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, is &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, the swan, according to the Septuagint; porphyrio, the fish-heron, according to the Vulgate; a marsh-bird therefore, possibly vultur percnopterus (Saad. Ar. Erp.), which is very common in Arabia, Palestine, and Syria, and was classed by the ancients among the different species of eagles (Plin. h. n. 10, 3), but which is said to resemble the vulture, and was also called &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, the mountain-stork (Arist. h. an. 9, 32). It is a stinking and disgusting bird, of the raven kind, with black pinions; but with this exception it is quite white. It is also bald-headed, and feeds on carrion and filth. But it is eaten notwithstanding by many of the Arabs (Burckhardt, Syr. p. 1046). It received its name of "tenderly loving" from the tenderness with which it watches over its young (Bochart, iii. pp. 56, 57). In this respect it resembles the stork, &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492;, avis pia, a bird of passage according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7</a>, which builds its nest upon the cypresses (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-17.htm">Psalm 104:17</a>, cf. Bochart, iii. pp. 85ff.). In the East the stork builds its nest not only upon high towers and the roofs of houses, but according to Kazwini and others mentioned by Bochart (iii. p. 60), upon lofty trees as well.<p>(Note: Oedmann (v. 58ff.), Knobel, and others follow the Greek translation of Leviticus and the Psalms, and the Vulgate rendering of Leviticus, the Psalms, and Job, and suppose the reference to be to the &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, herodius, the heron: but the name chasidah points decidedly to the stork, which was generally regarded by the ancients as pietatis cultrix (Petron. 55, 6), whereas, with the exception of the somewhat indefinite passage in Aelian (Nat. an. 3, 23), &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; (i.e., feed their young by spitting out their food) &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, nothing is said about the parental affection of the heron. And the testimony of Bellonius, "Ciconiae quae aetate in Europa sunt, magna hyemis parte ut in Aegypto sic etiam circa Antiochiam et juxta Amanum montem degunt," is a sufficient answer to Knobel's assertion, that according to Seetzen there are not storks in Mount Lebanon.)<p>&#1488;&#1504;&#1508;&#1492;, according to the lxx and Vulgate &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, a marsh-bird of the snipe kind, of which there are several species in Egypt (Hasselquist, p. 308). This is quite in accordance with the expression "after her kind," which points to a numerous genus. The omission of &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; before &#1492;&#1488;&#1504;&#1508;&#1492;, whereas it is found before the name of every other animal, is very striking; but as the name is preceded by the copulative vav in Deuteronomy, and stands for a particular bird, it may be accounted for either from a want of precision on the part of the author, or from an error of the copyist like the omission of the &#1493; before &#1488;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-15.htm">Leviticus 11:15</a>.<p>(Note: On account of the omission of &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; Knobel would connect &#1492;&#1488;&#1504;&#1508;&#1492; as an adjective with &#1492;&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492;, and explain &#1488;&#1504;&#1507; as derived from &#1506;&#1504;&#1507; frons, &#1506;&#1504;&#1507; frondens, and signifying bushy. The herons were called "the bushy chasidah," he supposes, because they have a tuft of feathers at the back of their head, or long feathers hanging down from their neck, which are wanting in the other marsh-birds, such as the flamingo, crane, and ibis. But there is this important objection to the explanation, that the change of &#1488; for &#1506; in such a word as &#1506;&#1504;&#1507; frons, which occurs as early as <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a>, and has retained its &#1506; even in the Aramaean dialects, is destitute of all probability. In addition to this, there is the improbability of the chasidah being restricted by anaphah to the different species of heron, with three of which the ancients were acquainted (Aristot. h. an. 9, 2; Plin. h. n. 10, 60). If chasidah denoted the heron generally, or the white heron, the epithet anaphah would be superfluous. It would be necessary to assume, therefore, that chasidah denotes the whole tribe of marsh-birds, and that Moses simply intended to prohibit the heron or bushy marsh-bird. But either of these is very improbable: the former, because in every other passage of the Old Testament chasidah stands for one particular kind of bird; the latter, because Moses could hardly have excluded storks, ibises, and other marsh-birds that live on worms, from his prohibition. All that remains, therefore, is to separate ha-anaphah from the preceding word, as in Deuteronomy, and to understand it as denoting the plover (?) or heron, as there were several species of both. Which is intended, it is impossible to decide, as there is nothing certain to be gathered from either the ancient versions or the etymology. Bochart's reference of the word to a fierce bird, viz., a species of eagle, which the Arabs call Tammaj, is not raised into a probability by a comparison with the similarly sounding &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1; of Od. 1, 320, by which Aristarchus understands a kind of eagle.)<p>&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;&#1508;&#1514;: according to the lxx, Vulg., and others, the lapwing, which is found in Syria, Arabia, and still more commonly in Egypt (Forsk, Russel, Sonnini), and is eaten in some places, as its flesh is said to be fat and savoury in autumn (Sonn. 1, 204). But it has a disagreeable smell, as it frequents marshy districts seeking worms and insects for food, and according to a common belief among the ancients, builds its nest of human dung. Lastly, &#1492;&#1506;&#1496;&#1500;&#1468;&#1507; is the bat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20</a>), which the Arabs also classified among the birds. </body></html>
