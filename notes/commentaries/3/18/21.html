Molech, also called Milcom, which denotes king, is described as the hideous idol, or “the abomination of the Ammonites” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-5.htm" title="For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.">1Kings 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-11.htm" title="Why the LORD said to Solomon, For as much as this is done of you, and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely rend the kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant.">1Kings 11:11</a>). The following graphic description has been handed down traditionally of this idol and its worship :—“Our sages of blessed memory say that whilst all other idols had temples in Jerusalem, Molech had his temple outside Jerusalem, in a place by itself. It was a brass and hollow image, bull-headed, with arms stretched out like a human being who opens his hands to receive something from his neighbour. Its temple had seven compartments, into which the offerers went according to their respective gifts. If one offered a fowl, he went into the first compartment; if a sheep, into the second; if a lamb, into the third; if a ram, into the fourth; if a bullock, into the fifth; if an ox, into the sixth; and if he offered his son, he was conducted into the seventh compartment. He first kissed the image, as it is written, ‘let the sacrificers of men kiss the calf’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-2.htm" title="And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.">Hosea 13:2</a>), whereupon a fire was kindled in Molech till its arms became red hot; the child was then put into its hands, and drums were beaten to produce tremendous noises so as to prevent the shrieks of the child reaching the father’s ears, lest he should be moved with pity towards his offspring.” It was to this idol that Solomon erected a temple on the southern side of Mount Olivet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm" title="And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.">2Kings 23:13</a>). This idolatrous worship was punished with death by stoning. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-2.htm" title="Again, you shall say to the children of Israel, Whoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that gives any of his seed to Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.">Leviticus 20:2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Neither shalt thou profane.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">And thou shalt not profane, </span>that is, by causing other nations to say that the Israelites regard their God as an inferior deity, and hence offer unto him animals, whilst to Molech they sacrifice their own children. Hence any act which is done in violation of his commands, or misrepresents God, or by which He is put on a par with other gods, is called “profaning the name of God.” (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-12.htm" title="And you shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shall you profane the name of your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-3.htm" title="And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he has given of his seed to Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.">Leviticus 20:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-6.htm" title="They shall be holy to their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.">Leviticus 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-2.htm" title="Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow to me: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 22:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-32.htm" title="Neither shall you profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,">Leviticus 22:32</a>, &c.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-21.htm" title="And you shall not let any of your seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shall you profane the name of your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 18:21</a></span>. <span class="ital">Pass through the fire to Molech — </span>In the Hebrew it is only <span class="ital">pass through to Molech. </span>But though the word <span class="ital">fire </span>be not in the original, it is reasonably supplied from other places, where it is expressed, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-10.htm" title="There shall not be found among you any one that makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that uses divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch.">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-10.htm" title="And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.">2 Kings 23:10</a>. <span class="ital">Molech, </span>called also <span class="ital">Milcom, </span>was the idol of the Ammonites. The name signifies <span class="ital">king, </span>or <span class="ital">regal dominion, </span>and is thought to denote the <span class="ital">sun, </span>the supreme, and probably the first object of idolatrous worship. Or, as others, the planet <span class="ital">Saturn; </span>for it appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-26.htm" title="But you have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.">Amos 5:26</a>, that Molech represented one of the celestial luminaries. Now, as fire is a fit emblem of the sun, the causing their seed to <span class="ital">pass through the fire </span>is thought to have been a rite of purification whereby parents consecrated their children to that deity, either by waving them over the fire, or by making them walk between two fires, or jump over a fire. This is the opinion of many able interpreters. But Selden, who has given a large account of this idol, and of the rites with which it was worshipped, shows, from several testimonies, that the Phœnicians, and other nations in the neighbourhood of Judea, actually sacrificed their children, in times of great calamity, to this blood-thirsty demon. Accordingly this phrase of <span class="ital">causing them to pass through the fire, </span>signifies sacrificing them in the following horrid manner, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/16-20.htm" title="Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne to me, and these have you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Is this of your prostitutions a small matter,...">Ezekiel 16:20-21</a>. Fagius informs us, that the image of Molech was of brass, contrived with seven cells or receptacles, probably representing the seven planets, the first for receiving an offering of flour; the second of turtle-doves; the third for a ewe; the fourth for a ram; the fifth for a calf; the sixth for an ox; the seventh for a child. who, being shut up in this cell, as in a furnace, was therein burned to death, while the people danced about the idol, and beat timbrels, that the cries of the tormented infant might not be heard. We have authority from the sacred writings to believe that these nations actually sacrificed their children to that grim idol, in some such horrid manner. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm" title="And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.">Jeremiah 7:31</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-35.htm" title="And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.">Jeremiah 32:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-5.htm" title="They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind:">Jeremiah 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/106-37.htm" title="Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to devils,...">Psalm 106:37-38</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/16-20.htm" title="Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne to me, and these have you sacrificed to them to be devoured.

And Le Clerc ingeniously conjectures, that this phrase, <span class="ital">passing through to Molech, </span>was invented by the impious priests, in order to convey a softer idea of that horrid rite. We may further observe, that there was a place near Jerusalem, where this horrid custom was observed. It was called <span class="ital">the valley of the sons of Hinnom, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>,) from the yelling of the sacrificed infants.

His statue was of brass, and rested on a pedestal or throne of the same metal. His head, resembling that of a calf, was adorned with a crown, and his arms were extended in the attitude of embracing those who approached him. His devotees dedicated their children to him; and when this was to be done, they heated the statue to a high pitch of intensity by a fire within, and then the infants were either shaken over the flames, or passed through the ignited arms, by way of lustration to ensure the favor of the pretended deity. The fire-worshippers asserted that all children who did not undergo this purifying process would die in infancy; and the influence of this Zabian superstition was still so extensively prevalent in the days of Moses, that the divine lawgiver judged it necessary to prohibit it by an express statute.<p>neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God&#8212;by giving it to false or pretended divinities; or, perhaps, from this precept standing in close connection with the worship of Molech, the meaning rather is, Do not, by devoting your children to him, give foreigners occasion to blaspheme the name of your God as a cruel and sanguinary deity, who demands the sacrifice of human victims, and who encourages cruelty in his votaries.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Pass through the fire</span> this was done two ways; either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

What was the nature and purpose of the idolatrous rite in question is, however, uncertain. It is generally assumed that reference is made to the practice of offering children in sacrifice to Molech, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-20.htm">Ezekiel 16:20</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-37.htm">Psalm 106:37</a> being quoted in support of that view. But it is by no means certain that this was the case. It might have been a rite by which children were dedicated to Molech - a baptism by fire, not resulting in the death of the child. Its mention here, in close connection with carnal sins, has led some to regard it as an impure rite; but this is a mistaken inference, for the prohibition of adultery naturally suggests the prohibition of a spiritual unfaithfulness. That it was some kind of idolatrous ceremony is shown by the addition of the words, <span class="cmt_word">neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God.</span> But if the children were burnt to death in honour of the idol, from the beginning, we should expect to find a notice of the fact in less ambiguous language than the expression, <span class="accented">pass through the fire</span>, conveys, earlier than the days of Ahaz. It is easy to imagine that what began as a dedication ceremony may have become converted into an absolute sacrifice, retaining still its original designation. Molech was a Canaanitish and Phoenician deity, the name meaning King, just as Baal means Lord (see Selden, 'De Diis Syris,' 1:6). Jarchi, quoted by Wordsworth, describes the idol as "made of brass, having the face of an ox, with arms stretched out, in which the child was placed and burnt with fire, while the priests were beating drums, in order to drown the noise of its shrieks, lest the fathers might be moved with pity thereby." The place where the children were offered, in the later period of the Jewish history, was the valley of Hinnom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Jeremiah 32:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Sexual connection with a daughter-in-law, a son's wife, is called &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-12.htm">Leviticus 20:12</a>, and threatened with death to both the parties concerned. &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;, from &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500; to mix, to confuse, signifies a sinful mixing up or confusing of the divine ordinances by unnatural unchastity, like the lying of a woman with a beast, which is the only other connection in which the word occurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-23.htm">Leviticus 18:23</a>). </body></html>
