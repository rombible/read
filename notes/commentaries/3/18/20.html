(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm" title="And the man that commits adultery with another man's wife, even he that commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.">Leviticus 20:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-22.htm" title="If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shall you put away evil from Israel.">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-38.htm" title="And I will judge you, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give you blood in fury and jealousy.">Ezekiel 16:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-40.htm" title="They shall also bring up a company against you, and they shall stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords.">Ezekiel 16:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-5.htm" title="Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what say you?">John 8:5</a>.) In Egypt the adulterer received a thousand strokes with a stick, and the guilty woman had her nose cut off, and to this day the criminal wife among the Bedouins is executed by her husband, father, or brother, without any mercy. Both criminals were also punished with death among other Eastern nations.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:1-30 Unlawful marriages and fleshly lusts. - Here is a law against all conformity to the corrupt usages of the heathen. Also laws against incest, against brutal lusts, and barbarous idolatries; and the enforcement of these laws from the ruin of the Canaanites. God here gives moral precepts. Close and constant adherence to God's ordinances is the most effectual preservative from gross sin. The grace of God only will secure us; that grace is to be expected only in the use of the means of grace. Nor does He ever leave any to their hearts' lusts, till they have left him and his services.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To vex her - literally, to "bind" or "pack together".

Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her&#8212;The original is rendered in the Margin, "neither shalt thou take one wife to another to vex her," and two different and opposite interpretations have been put upon this passage. The marginal construction involves an express prohibition of polygamy; and, indeed, there can be no doubt that the practice of having more wives than one is directly contrary to the divine will. It was prohibited by the original law of marriage, and no evidence of its lawfulness under the Levitical code can be discovered, although Moses&#8212;from "the hardness of their hearts" [Mt 19:8; Mr 10:5]&#8212;tolerated it in the people of a rude and early age. The second interpretation forms the ground upon which the "vexed question" has been raised in our times respecting the lawfulness of marriage with a deceased wife's sister. Whatever arguments may be used to prove the unlawfulness or inexpediency of such a matrimonial relation, the passage under consideration cannot, on a sound basis of criticism, be enlisted in the service; for the crimes with which it is here associated warrant the conclusion that it points not to marriage with a deceased wife's sister, but with a sister in the wife's lifetime, a practice common among the ancient Egyptians, Chaldeans, and others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Moreover, thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife,....

From this it is obvious that sexual connection with the sister of either father or mother was not to be punished with death by the magistrate, but would be punished with disease by God Himself. </body></html>
