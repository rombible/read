The daughter must not marry or have commerce with the father, nor the son with the mother. Hence the Chaldee Version of Jonathan translates it “the woman shall not lie with her father, and the man shall not lie with his mother.” Accordingly the case here contemplated is that of Lot’s daughters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/19-31.htm" title="And the firstborn said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth:">Genesis 19:31-38</a>). This passage may, however, be translated literally, <span class= "ital">the nakedness of thy father, and the nakedness of thy mother shalt thou not uncover. </span>That is, they being both one flesh, the nakedness of the one is the nakedness of the other. Amongst the Persians and other eastern nations, marriage between son and mother was allowed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-7.htm" title="The nakedness of your father, or the nakedness of your mother, shall you not uncover: she is your mother; you shall not uncover her nakedness.">Leviticus 18:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">The nakedness of thy father, or of thy mother — </span>This is but one fact, though expressed two ways, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-8.htm" title="The nakedness of your father's wife shall you not uncover: it is your father's nakedness.">Leviticus 18:8</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-11.htm" title="And the man that lies with his father's wife has uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be on them.">Leviticus 20:11</a>.

Also laws against incest, against brutal lusts, and barbarous idolatries; and the enforcement of these laws from the ruin of the Canaanites. God here gives moral precepts. Close and constant adherence to God's ordinances is the most effectual preservative from gross sin. The grace of God only will secure us; that grace is to be expected only in the use of the means of grace.

None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him&#8212;Very great laxity prevailed amongst the Egyptians in their sentiments and practice about the conjugal relation, as they not only openly sanctioned marriages between brothers and sisters, but even between parents and children. Such incestuous alliances Moses wisely prohibited, and his laws form the basis upon which the marriage regulations of this and other Christian nations are chiefly founded. This verse contains a general summary of all the particular prohibitions; and the forbidden intercourse is pointed out by the phrase, "to approach to." In the specified prohibitions that follow, all of which are included in this general summary, the prohibited familiarity is indicated by the phrases, to "uncover the nakedness" [Le 18:12-17], to "take" [Le 18:17, 18], and to "lie with" [Le 18:22, 23]. The phrase in this sixth verse, therefore, has the same identical meaning with each of the other three, and the marriages in reference to which it is used are those of consanguinity or too close affinity, amounting to incestuous connections.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of thy father, or of thy mother, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">and of thy mother</span>, put for <span class="ital">that is</span>, or <span class="ital">to wit</span>, as it is oft used. Here it notes that the nakedness of the father, and the nakedness of the mother, are one and the same thing, because they two are one flesh, and therefore her nakedness is his also; which further appears, because the mother only is mentioned in the following words, which contain the reason of the law. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">She is thy mother; </span> and therefore even nature teacheth thee to abhor such incest.

By uncovering a father's nakedness is not meant anything similar to what befell Noah, which Ham beheld with pleasure, and the other two sons of Noah studiously and with reverence to their father covered; nor any sodomitical practice of a son with his father; as Gersom interprets it; but the same is meant by both phrases, and the words are by many interpreters thus rendered, "the nakedness of thy father, that is (x), the nakedness of thy mother thou shalt not uncover": for what is the mother's is the father's, and uncovering the one is uncovering the other; wherefore the mother only is made mention of in the next clause, where the reason of this prohibition is given: <p>she is thy mother, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness; that is, not lie with her, nor marry her, because she is his mother that bore him, of whom he was born, and therefore ought not to become his wife, or be taken into his bed; such a marriage must be incestuous and shocking; such were the marriages of Oedipus with his mother Jocasta, and of Nero with Agrippina; though the words will bear another sense, that a woman may not marry her father, which may be meant by the first clause, nor a man his mother, intended in the next; and where indeed it is not expressed, females in the same degree of relation are included with the males, and under the same prohibition; and so the Targum of Jonathan explains this, a woman shall not have to do with her father, nor a man with his mother; as Lot's two daughters had with him, and the Persians with their mothers; among whom such incestuous marriages and copulations were frequent, and especially among their Magi (y) who might not perform their office unless they had lain with their mothers, sisters, and daughters (z), or were begotten in such incest (a): a man guilty of such incestuous copulations was cursed by the law of Moses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-20.htm">Deuteronomy 27:20</a>; this is contrary to nature, what the brute creation abhors; a camel will not cover its dam: Aristotle (b) reports of one who was betrayed into it by his keeper, who, after he had discovered it, fixed his teeth in him and slew him; and he also relates of a horse after that he had ignorantly done the same, ran away in great haste and cast himself down from a precipice headlong. <p>(x) "id est, nuditatem vel pudenda", Vatablus, Fagius, Piscator.

On account of the unity caused by marriage ("they shall be one flesh," <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>), the stepmother's nakedness <span class="cmt_word">is the father's nakedness</span>. The tie of affinity is thus declared to be similar in its effects to the tie of consanguinity. Reuben's sin, by which he forfeited his birthright, is connected with this offense, but is of a more heinous character, as his father was alive at the time of his transgression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>). It is one of the sins which Ezekiel enumerates as those which brought the judgment of God on Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-10.htm">Ezekiel 22:10</a>). "That one should have his father's wife" is declared by St. Paul to be "such fornication as is not named among the Gentiles," and to call for the excommunication of the offender (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1-5</a>). Adonijah's marriage with Abishag, so strongly resented by Solomon on political grounds, is not denounced as morally reprehensible, probably because Abishag was not the wife of David in such a way as to cause the marriage with his son to be abominable in the eye of the law (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-4.htm">1 Kings 1:4</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-7.htm">Amos 2:7</a>). Absalom's" going in unto his father's concubines" was regarded as the final act which made reconciliation with his father impossible (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-22.htm">2 Samuel 16:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-3.htm">2 Samuel 20:3</a>). The history of the Church has shown that marriage with the stepmother has had to be again and again prohibited by Council after Council (see Smith and Cheetham's 'Dictionary of Antiquities,' <span class="accented">s.v.</span> 'Prohibited Degrees'). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Holiness of the Marriage Relation. - The prohibition of incest and similar sensual abominations is introduced with a general warning as to the licentious customs of the Egyptians and Canaanites, and an exhortation to walk in the judgments and ordinances of Jehovah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-2.htm">Leviticus 18:2-5</a>), and is brought to a close with a threatening allusion to the consequences of all such defilements (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-30</a>).<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-1.htm">Leviticus 18:1-4</a><p>By the words, "I am Jehovah your God," which are placed at the head and repeated at the close (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-30.htm">Leviticus 18:30</a>), the observance of the command is enforced upon the people as a covenant obligation, and urged upon them most strongly by the promise, that through the observance of the ordinances and judgments of Jehovah they should live (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a>).</body></html>
