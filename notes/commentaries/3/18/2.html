Moreover, as He is holy, the Israelites, by faithfully obeying His sacred laws, will attain to that holiness which will bring them in communion with Him in whose image they were created. This phrase, which is so emphatically repeated twice more in this chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-4.htm" title="You shall do my judgments, and keep my ordinances, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-30.htm" title="Therefore shall you keep my ordinance, that you commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that you defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 18:30</a>), has only been used once before in this book. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-44.htm" title="For I am the LORD your God: you shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and you shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall you defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creeps on the earth.">Leviticus 11:44</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 18:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Your God — </span>Your sovereign and lawgiver.

Close and constant adherence to God's ordinances is the most effectual preservative from gross sin.

In <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a> the prohibition of the eating of blood is repeated, and ordered to be observed on pain of extermination; it is also extended to the strangers in Israel; and after a more precise explanation of the reason for the law, is supplemented by instructions for the disposal of the blood of edible game. God threatens that He will inflict the punishment Himself, because the eating of blood was a transgression of the law which might easily escape the notice of the authorities. "To set one's face against:" i.e., to judge. The reason for the command in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, "For the soul of the flesh (the soul which gives life to the flesh) is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar, to make an atonement for your souls," is not a double one, viz., (1) because the blood contained the soul of the animal, and (2) because God had set apart the blood, as the medium of expiation for the human soul, for the altar, i.e., to be sprinkled upon the altar. The first reason simply forms the foundation for the second: God appointed the blood for the altar, as containing the soul of the animal, to be the medium of expiation for the souls of men, and therefore prohibited its being used as food. "For the blood it expiates by virtue of the soul," not "the soul" itself. &#1489;&#1468; with &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; has only a local or instrumental signification (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-23.htm">Leviticus 6:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-17.htm">Leviticus 16:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-27.htm">Leviticus 16:27</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-7.htm">Leviticus 7:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-33.htm">Exodus 29:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-8.htm">Numbers 5:8</a>). Accordingly, it was not the blood as such, but the blood as the vehicle of the soul, which possessed expiatory virtue; because the animal soul was offered to God upon the altar as a substitute for the human soul. Hence every bleeding sacrifice had an expiatory force, though without being an expiatory sacrifice in the strict sense of the word.</body></html>
