Also laws against incest, against brutal lusts, and barbarous idolatries; and the enforcement of these laws from the ruin of the Canaanites. God here gives moral precepts. Close and constant adherence to God's ordinances is the most effectual preservative from gross sin. The grace of God only will secure us; that grace is to be expected only in the use of the means of grace. Nor does He ever leave any to their hearts' lusts, till they have left him and his services.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The land designed and consecrated for His people by Yahweh <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a> is here impersonated, and represented as vomiting forth its present inhabitants, in consequence of their indulgence in the abominations that have been mentioned. The iniquity of the Canaanites was now full. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1-6</a>. The Israelites in this place, and throughout the chapter, are exhorted to a pure and holy life, on the ground that Yahweh, the Holy One, is their God and that they are His people. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>. It is upon this high sanction that they are peremptorily forbidden to defile themselves with the pollutions of the pagan. The only punishment here pronounced upon individual transgressors is, that they shall "bear their iniquity" and be "cut off from among their people." We must understand this latter phrase as expressing an "ipso facto" excommunication or outlawry, the divine Law pronouncing on the offender an immediate forfeiture of the privileges which belonged to him as one of the people in covenant with Yahweh. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14</a> note. The course which the Law here takes seems to be first to appeal to the conscience of the individual man on the ground of his relation to Yahweh, and then <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20.htm">Leviticus 20</a> to enact such penalties as the order of the state required, and as represented the collective conscience of the nation put into operation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. the souls that commit them shall be cut off&#8212;This strong denunciatory language is applied to all the crimes specified in the chapter without distinction: to incest as truly as to bestiality, and to the eleven cases of affinity [Le 18:7-16], as fully as to the six of consanguinity [Le 18:17-20]. Death is the punishment sternly denounced against all of them. No language could be more explicit or universal; none could more strongly indicate intense loathing and abhorrence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To wit, by death to be inflicted by the magistrates, as it is apparent in case of idolatry with Moloch or other false gods; and in case of the magistrates neglect, by God himself. This phrase therefore of cutting off is to be understood variously, as many other phrases are, either of ecclesiastical, or civil and corporal punishment, according to the differing natures of the offences for which it is inflicted. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations,....

"Into no beast shalt thou give thine emission of seed,...and a woman shall not place herself before a beast to lie down thereto." &#1512;&#1489;&#1506;  equals  &#1512;&#1489;&#1509; "to lie," is the term used particularly to denote a crime of this description (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-13.htm">Leviticus 20:13</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-15.htm">Leviticus 20:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-16.htm">Leviticus 20:16</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-18.htm">Exodus 22:18</a>). Lying with animals was connected in Egypt with the worship of the goat; at Mendes especially, where the women lay down before he-goats (Herodotus, 2, 46; Strabo, 17, p. 802). Aelian (nat. an. vii. 19) relates an account of the crime being also committed with a dog in Rome; and according to Sonnini, R. 11, p. 330, in modern Egypt men are said to lie even with female crocodiles. </body></html>
