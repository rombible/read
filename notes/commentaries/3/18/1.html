MORAL UNCLEANNESS AND ITS PUNISHMENT. This being the subject of the three following chapters (chapters 18-20), they naturally form a sequence to chapters 11-17, which have dealt with ceremonial uncleanness and its purification. It is a remarkable thing that, except by implication in connection with the sin offerings and the trespass offerings and the ceremonies of the Day of Atonement, there has not yet been a single moral precept, as such, in the Book of Leviticus, and there has been very little recognition of sin as distinct from pollution. All has been ceremonial. But the ceremonial is typical of the moral, and from the consideration of ceremonial uncleanness and its remedy, we now proceed to the consideration of moral uncleanness and its penalty. It is to be noticed too that, while the ensuing laws are commanded as the positive injunction of God (verses 2, 30), which of itself is sufficient to give them their authority and force, they are still founded, like the ceremonial prohibitions, upon the feelings of repugnance implanted in the mind of man. To enter into the marriage relation with near relatives is abhorrent to a sentiment in mankind so widely spread that it may be deemed to have been originally universal, and the same abhorrence is entertained towards other foul sins of lust. Ugliness, which creates disgust by its ugliness, symbolizes sin; immorality, which inspires abhorrence by its immoral character, proves itself thereby to be sin. The section deals first with sin in the marriage relation, next with sexual impurities connected with marriage, then with other cases of immorality, and lastly with the penalties inflicted on these sins in their character of crimes. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-5</span> form an introduction to the Hebrew code of prohibited degrees of marriage and of forbidden sins of lust. The formal and solemn declaration, <span class="cmt_word">I am the Lord your God</span>, is made three times in these five verses. This places before the people the two thoughts: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the Lord is holy, and they ought to be like him in holiness; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the Lord has commanded holiness, and they ought to obey him by being holy. Because the Lord is their God, and they are his people, they are, negatively, to refrain from the vicious habits and lax customs prevalent in <span class="cmt_word">the land of Egypt wherein they dwelt</span>, and in the land of Canaan whither they were going, the sensuality of which is indirectly condemned by the injunctions which command purity in contrast to their <span class="cmt_word">doings</span>; and, positively, they are to <span class="cmt_word">keep God's statutes, and his judgments</span>, as laid down in the following code, <span class="cmt_word">which if a man do, he shall live in them</span>. The latter clause is of special importance, because it is repeated in the same connection by Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-11.htm">Ezekiel 20:11, 13, 21</a>), and in the Levitical confession in the Book of Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-29.htm">Nehemiah 9:29</a>), and is quoted by St. Paul in a controversial sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-12.htm">Galatians 3:12</a>). Its full meaning is that by obedience to God's commands man attains to a state of existence which alone deserves to be called true life - "the life which connects him with Jehovah through his obedience" (Clark). And this involves the further truth that disobedience results in death. Accordingly, St. Paul uses the text as being the testimony of the Law with regard to itself, that salvation by it is of works in contrast with faith. (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-28.htm">Luke 10:28</a>.) We have no evidence to tell us what were <span class="accented">the doings of the land of Canaan</span> in respect to the marriage relation, but this chapter is enough to show that the utmost laxity prevailed in it, and we may be sure that their religious rites, like those of Midian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25</a>), were penetrated with the spirit of licentiousness. With regard to <span class="accented">the doings of the land of Egypt</span>, we have fuller information. We know that among the Egyptians marriage with sisters and half-sisters was not only permissible, but that its propriety was justified by their religious beliefs, and practiced in the royal family (Died. Sic., 1:27; Die. Cass., 42). Other abominations condemned in this chapter (verse 23) also, as we know, existed there (Herod., 2:46), and if queens could be what in later times Cleopatra was, we may imagine the general dissoluteness of the people. Among Persians, Medes, Indians, Ethiopians and Assyrians, marriage with mothers and daughters was allowed, and from the time of Cambyses, marriage with a sister was regarded as lawful (Herod., 3:31). The Athenians and Spartans permitted marriage with half-sisters. All these concessions to lust, and ether unclean acts with which the heathen world was full (verse 22; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-27.htm">Romans 1:27</a>), were fallings away from the law of purity implanted in the heart of man and now renewed for the Hebrew people. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To this there are appended three laws, which are kindred in their nature, and which were binding not only upon the Israelites, but also upon the foreigners who dwelt in the midst of them.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8-12</a><p><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-9.htm">Leviticus 17:9</a> contain the command, that whoever offered a burnt-offering of slain-offering, and did not bring it to the tabernacle to prepare it for Jehovah there, was to be exterminated; a command which involved the prohibition of sacrifice in any other place whatever, and was given, as the further extension of this law in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12.htm">Deuteronomy 12</a> clearly proves, for the purpose of suppressing the disposition to offer sacrifice to other gods, as well as in other places. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a> the prohibition of the eating of blood is repeated, and ordered to be observed on pain of extermination; it is also extended to the strangers in Israel; and after a more precise explanation of the reason for the law, is supplemented by instructions for the disposal of the blood of edible game. God threatens that He will inflict the punishment Himself, because the eating of blood was a transgression of the law which might easily escape the notice of the authorities. "To set one's face against:" i.e., to judge. The reason for the command in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, "For the soul of the flesh (the soul which gives life to the flesh) is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar, to make an atonement for your souls," is not a double one, viz., (1) because the blood contained the soul of the animal, and (2) because God had set apart the blood, as the medium of expiation for the human soul, for the altar, i.e., to be sprinkled upon the altar. The first reason simply forms the foundation for the second: God appointed the blood for the altar, as containing the soul of the animal, to be the medium of expiation for the souls of men, and therefore prohibited its being used as food. "For the blood it expiates by virtue of the soul," not "the soul" itself. &#1489;&#1468; with &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; has only a local or instrumental signification (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-23.htm">Leviticus 6:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-17.htm">Leviticus 16:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-27.htm">Leviticus 16:27</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-7.htm">Leviticus 7:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-33.htm">Exodus 29:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-8.htm">Numbers 5:8</a>). Accordingly, it was not the blood as such, but the blood as the vehicle of the soul, which possessed expiatory virtue; because the animal soul was offered to God upon the altar as a substitute for the human soul. Hence every bleeding sacrifice had an expiatory force, though without being an expiatory sacrifice in the strict sense of the word.</body></html>
