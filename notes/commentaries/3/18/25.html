The physical condition of the land, therefore, depends upon the moral conduct of man. When he disobeys God’s commandments she is parched up and does not yield her fruit” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-17.htm" title="And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest you perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD gives you.">Deuteronomy 11:17</a>). “The land is defiled” when he defiles himself. When he walks in the way of the Divine commands she is blessed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-19.htm" title="And the land shall yield her fruit, and you shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.">Leviticus 25:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-4.htm" title="Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.">Leviticus 26:4</a>); “God is merciful unto his land and to his people” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-43.htm" title="Rejoice, O you nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful to his land, and to his people.">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>). Hence, “the earth mourneth” when her inhabitants sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/24-4.htm" title="The earth mourns and fades away, the world languishes and fades away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.">Isaiah 24:4-5</a>), and “the earth is glad” when God avenges the cause of His people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/96-11.htm" title="Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof.">Psalm 96:11-13</a>). It is owing to this intimate connection between them that the land, which is here personified, is represented as loathing the wicked conduct of her children and being unable to restrain them. She nauseated them. The same figure is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-28.htm" title="That the land spew not you out also, when you defile it, as it spewed out the nations that were before you.">Leviticus 18:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-22.htm" title="You shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, where I bring you to dwell therein, spew you not out.">Leviticus 20:22</a>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-16.htm" title="So then because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew you out of my mouth.">Revelation 3:16</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:1-30 Unlawful marriages and fleshly lusts. - Here is a law against all conformity to the corrupt usages of the heathen. Also laws against incest, against brutal lusts, and barbarous idolatries; and the enforcement of these laws from the ruin of the Canaanites. God here gives moral precepts. Close and constant adherence to God's ordinances is the most effectual preservative from gross sin. The grace of God only will secure us; that grace is to be expected only in the use of the means of grace. Nor does He ever leave any to their hearts' lusts, till they have left him and his services.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The land designed and consecrated for His people by Yahweh <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a> is here impersonated, and represented as vomiting forth its present inhabitants, in consequence of their indulgence in the abominations that have been mentioned. The iniquity of the Canaanites was now full. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1-6</a>. The Israelites in this place, and throughout the chapter, are exhorted to a pure and holy life, on the ground that Yahweh, the Holy One, is their God and that they are His people. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>. It is upon this high sanction that they are peremptorily forbidden to defile themselves with the pollutions of the pagan. The only punishment here pronounced upon individual transgressors is, that they shall "bear their iniquity" and be "cut off from among their people." We must understand this latter phrase as expressing an "ipso facto" excommunication or outlawry, the divine Law pronouncing on the offender an immediate forfeiture of the privileges which belonged to him as one of the people in covenant with Yahweh. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14</a> note. The course which the Law here takes seems to be first to appeal to the conscience of the individual man on the ground of his relation to Yahweh, and then <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20.htm">Leviticus 20</a> to enact such penalties as the order of the state required, and as represented the collective conscience of the nation put into operation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it; and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants&#8212;The Canaanites, as enormous and incorrigible sinners, were to be exterminated; and this extermination was manifestly a judicial punishment inflicted by a ruler whose laws had been grossly and perseveringly outraged. But before a law can be disobeyed, it must have been previously in existence; and hence a law, prohibiting all the horrid crimes enumerated above&#8212;a law obligatory upon the Canaanites as well as other nations&#8212;was already known and in force before the Levitical law of incest was promulgated. Some general Iaw, then, prohibiting these crimes must have been published to mankind at a very early period of the world's history; and that law must either have been the moral law, originally written on the human heart, or a law on the institution of marriage revealed to Adam and known to the Canaanites and others by tradition or otherwise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I do visit; </span> I am now visiting, or about to visit, i. e. to punish.
