But our unfitness for duty, when it is natural and not sinful, will have great allowances made for it; God will have mercy, and not sacrifice. Let us profit by the solemn warning this history conveys. When professing worshippers come with zeal without knowledge, carnal affections, earthly, light, vain, trifling thoughts, the devices of will-worship, instead of the offering of soul and spirit; then the incense is kindled by a flame which never came down from heaven, which the Spirit of a holy God never sent within their hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The argument is, that as such meals were appointed in honor of Yahweh Himself, they ought to be conducted with due reverence and discretion.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-12.htm">Leviticus 10:12</a><p>Beside the altar - What is called "the holy place" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-13.htm">Leviticus 10:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-17.htm">Leviticus 10:17</a> : it should be rather, a holy place, any part of the holy precinct, as distinguished from a merely "clean place" <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-14.htm">Leviticus 10:14</a>, either within or without the court of the tabernacle.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-15.

The anointing oil was the symbol of the Spirit of God, which is a Spirit of life, and therefore has nothing in common with death, but rather conquers death, and sin, which is the source of death (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-12.htm">Leviticus 21:12</a>). </body></html>
