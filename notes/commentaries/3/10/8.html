To comfort him, therefore, as well as to restore the prestige of this sacred office in the eyes of the people, who had witnessed the disobedience and punishment of the spiritual functionaries, the Lord, who hitherto made all such communications to Moses, now honours Aaron with speaking to him immediately.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:8-11 Do not drink wine or strong drink. During the time they ministered, the priests were forbidden it. It is required of gospel ministers, that they be not given to wine, 1Ti 3:3. It is, Lest ye die; die when ye are in drink. The danger of death, to which we are continually exposed, should engage all to be sober.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The anointing oil ... is upon you - See <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-12.htm">Leviticus 8:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-30.htm">Leviticus 8:30</a>. The holy oil, as the symbol of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Life and immortality and joy, was the sign of the priests being brought near to Yahweh. It was therefore by its meaning connected both with the general law which forbade the high priest ever to put on signs of mourning on account of death <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10-12</a>, and with the special reason for the prohibition on this occasion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-11. Do not drink wine nor strong drink&#8212;This prohibition, and the accompanying admonitions, following immediately the occurrence of so fatal a catastrophe [Le 10:1, 2], has given rise to an opinion entertained by many, that the two disobedient priests were under the influence of intoxication when they committed the offense which was expiated only by their lives. But such an idea, though the presumption is in its favor, is nothing more than conjecture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord spake unto Aaron,.... Because he was a prophet, Aben Ezra says; but the reason rather seems to be, because be was the high priest, and now invested with his office, and in the execution of it, and therefore the following law respecting the priest's drinking of wine was given: some say, as the same writer observes, that God spake to him by Moses; but it rather seems that he spoke to Aaron immediately: according to Jarchi, this order was delivered to him as a reward for his silence, and to do honour to him on that account: saying; as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div> TO ABSTAIN FROM WINE (verses 8-11). The law given to Aaron (some manuscripts read Moses) against the use of wine by the priests during their ministrations, by its juxtaposition with what has gone before, has led to the probable supposition that Nadab and Abihu had acted under the excitement of intoxicating drink. It is possible that the sacrificial meals on the peace offerings had begun, and that at the same time that the congregation was feasting, the two priests had refreshed themselves with wine after their long service. The special ceremonial meal of the priests had not yet been eaten.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Nadab and Abihu took their censers (machtah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-38.htm">Exodus 25:38</a>), and having put fire in them, placed incense thereon, and brought strange fire before Jehovah, which He had not commanded them. It is not very clear what the offence of which they were guilty actually was. The majority of expositors suppose the sin to have consisted in the fact, that they did not take the fire for the incense from the altar-fire. But this had not yet been commanded by God; and in fact it is never commanded at all, except with regard to the incense-offering, with which the high priest entered the most holy place on the day of atonement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12</a>), though we may certainly infer from this, that it was also the rule for the daily incense-offering. By the fire which they offered before Jehovah, we are no doubt to understand the firing of the incense-offering. This might be called "strange fire" if it was not offered in the manner prescribed in the law, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-9.htm">Exodus 30:9</a> incense not prepared according to the direction of God is called "strange incense." The supposition that they presented an incense-offering that was not commanded in the law, and apart from the time of the morning and evening sacrifice, and that this constituted their sin, is supported by the time at which their illegal act took place. It is perfectly obvious from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-12.htm">Leviticus 10:12</a>. and 16ff. that it occurred in the interval between the sacrificial transaction in ch. 9 and the sacrificial meal which followed it, and therefore upon the day of their inauguration. For in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-12.htm">Leviticus 10:12</a> Moses commands Aaron and his remaining sons Eleazar and Ithamar to eat the meat-offering that was left from the firings of Jehovah, and inquires in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-16.htm">Leviticus 10:16</a> for the goat of the sin-offering, which the priests were to have eaten in a holy place. Knobel's opinion is not an improbable one, therefore, that Nadab and Abihu intended to accompany the shouts of the people with an incense-offering to the praise and glory of God, and presented an incense-offering not only at an improper time, but not prepared from the altar-fire, and committed such a sin by this will-worship, that they were smitten by the fire which came forth from Jehovah, even before their entrance into the holy place, and so died "before Jehovah." The expression "before Jehovah" is applied to the presence of God, both in the dwelling (viz., the holy place and the holy of holies, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-6.htm">Leviticus 4:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-13.htm">Leviticus 16:13</a>) and also in the court (e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>, etc.). It is in the latter sense that it is to be taken here, as is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-4.htm">Leviticus 10:4</a>, where the persons slain are said to have lain "before the sanctuary of the dwelling," i.e., in the court of the tabernacle. The fire of the holy God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>), which had just sanctified the service of Aaron as well-pleasing to God, brought destruction upon his two eldest sons, because they had not sanctified Jehovah in their hearts, but had taken upon themselves a self-willed service; just as the same gospel is to one a savour of life unto life, and to another a savour of death unto death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-16.htm">2 Corinthians 2:16</a>). - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a> Moses explains this judgment to Aaron: "This is it that Jehovah spake, saying, I will sanctify Myself in him that is nigh to Me, and will glorify Myself in the face of all the people." &#1488;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491; is unquestionably to be taken in the same sense as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-17.htm">Exodus 14:17</a>; consequently &#1488;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; is to be taken in a reflective and not in a passive sense, in the <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a>. The imperfects are used as aorists, in the sense of what God does at all times. But these words of Moses are no "reproof to Aaron, who had not restrained the untimely zeal of his sons" (Knobel), nor a reproach which made Aaron responsible for the conduct of his sons, but a simple explanation of the judgment of God, which should be taken to heart by every one, and involved an admonition to all who heard it, not to Aaron only but to the whole nation, to sanctify God continually in the proper way. Moreover Jehovah had not communicated to Moses by revelation the words which he spoke here, but had made the fact known by the position assigned to Aaron and his sons through their election to the priesthood. By this act Jehovah had brought them near to Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-5.htm">Numbers 16:5</a>), made them &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;  equals  &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; "persons standing near to Jehovah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-13.htm">Ezekiel 42:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-19.htm">Ezekiel 43:19</a>), and sanctified them to Himself by anointing (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-12.htm">Leviticus 8:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-44.htm">Exodus 29:44</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-13.htm">Exodus 40:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-15.htm">Exodus 40:15</a>), that they might sanctify Him in their office and life. If they neglected this sanctification, He sanctified Himself in them by a penal judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a>), and thereby glorified Himself as the Holy One, who is not to be mocked. "And Aaron held his peace." He was obliged to acknowledge the righteousness of the holy God. </body></html>
