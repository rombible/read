Let us profit by the solemn warning this history conveys. When professing worshippers come with zeal without knowledge, carnal affections, earthly, light, vain, trifling thoughts, the devices of will-worship, instead of the offering of soul and spirit; then the incense is kindled by a flame which never came down from heaven, which the Spirit of a holy God never sent within their hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That is: "Behold this very day, in which we have done our part in sacrificing sin-offerings and burnt-offerings to the Lord, this great calamity has befallen me.

Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt&#8212;In a sacrifice presented, as that had been, on behalf of the people, it was the duty of the priests, as typically representing them and bearing their sins, to have eaten the flesh after the blood had been sprinkled upon the altar. Instead of using it, however, for a sacred feast, they had burnt it without the camp; and Moses, who discovered this departure from the prescribed ritual, probably from a dread of some further chastisements, challenged, not Aaron, whose heart was too much lacerated to bear a new cause of distress but his two surviving sons in the priesthood for the great irregularity. Their father, however, who heard the charge and by whose directions the error had been committed, hastened to give the explanation. The import of his apology is, that all the duty pertaining to the presentation of the offering had been duly and sacredly performed, except the festive part of the observance, which privately devolved upon the priest and his family. And that this had been omitted, either because his heart was too dejected to join in the celebration of a cheerful feast, or that he supposed, from the appalling judgments that had been inflicted, that all the services of that occasion were so vitiated that he did not complete them. Aaron was decidedly in the wrong. By the express command of God, the sin offering was to be eaten in the holy place; and no fanciful view of expediency or propriety ought to have led him to dispense at discretion with a positive statute. The law of God was clear and, where that is the case, it is sin to deviate a hair's breadth from the path of duty. But Moses sympathized with his deeply afflicted brother and, having pointed out the error, said no more.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">This day have they offered; </span> they have done the substance of the thing, though they have mistaken this one circumstance. <span class="ital">Such things have befallen me</span>; whereby, having been oppressed with grief, and almost bereft of my reason, it is not strange nor unpardonable if I have mistaken. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Should it have been accepted?</span> because it was not to be eaten with sorrow, but with rejoicing and thanksgiving, as appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-7.htm" title="And there you shall eat before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households, wherein the LORD your God has blessed you.">Deu 12:7</a> 26:14 <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-4.htm" title="They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing to him: their sacrifices shall be to them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.">Hosea 9:4</a></span>; and I thought it fitter to burn it, as I did other sacred relics, than to profane it by eating it unworthily. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Aaron said unto Moses,.... For what Moses had said was said in his presence, though not addressed to him directly, but to his sons; and he was sensible that he was pointed at, and that if there was any blame in this affair, it lay as much or more on him than on his sons; and therefore he takes it upon him to give an answer, and to excuse the fact as well as he could: <p>behold, this day they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord; that is, the people of Israel had brought a kid of the goats for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb for burnt offering, and he and his sons assisting him, had offered them for them, even on the very day his two eldest sons were removed by death in an awful manner: <p>and such things have befallen me; at this very time, soon after the above sacrifices were offered, happened the death of his two sons, which occasioned great anguish and distress, grief and sorrow, so that he could not eat of the sin offering; he had no appetite for it, and if he had, he thought in his present circumstances it would not have been right, as follows: <p>and if I had eaten the sin offering today, should it have been accepted in the sight of the Lord? he being a mourner. The Jews say (u), an high priest may offer, being a mourner, but not eat; a common priest may neither offer nor eat; and which they illustrate by this passage, that Aaron offered and did not eat, but his sons did neither. <p>(u) Misn.

Aaron in his reply admits that he should have eaten the Sin-Offering, but gives as a reason for not doing so ‘there have befallen me such things as these.’ This is explained as a reference to the death of his sons. Aaron, Eleazar, and Ithamar were forbidden to mourn for them; but Aaron considered their death as a sign that God was displeased and refrained from eating the Sin-Offering. The whole incident presents difficulties which have not been satisfactorily explained, one of which is that the sacrifice to which Moses refers belongs to that class of which the priests were not to eat. The direction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-26.htm" title="The priest that offers it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 6:26</a>, that the priest who offers a Sin-Offering ‘shall eat it’ is there limited in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-30.htm" title="And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile with in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.">Leviticus 6:30</a>, by forbidding that this shall be done when any of the blood has been brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement. In accordance with this restriction, the rebuke by Moses in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-18.htm" title="Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: you should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.">Leviticus 10:18</a></span> is justified, but on the other hand it should be noted that no blood has yet been brought into the Holy place, not even that of the calf for Aaron’s Sin-Offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-8.htm" title="Aaron therefore went to the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.">Leviticus 9:8</a> ff.), and yet no objection against the burning of it was made by Moses.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For one who desired to defend the burning of all the parts the argument would be fairly obvious that the rules for the Sin-Offering of the priest as laid down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm" title="If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he has sinned, a young bullock without blemish to the LORD for a sin offering.">Leviticus 4:3</a> ff. direct this course. Aaron’s line of defence, however, is wholly different. Dillm. suggests that the section as it now stands has arisen through the expansion of an older and simpler narrative in P, in which was set forth the original disinclination of the priests to partake of the flesh of the Sin-Offering.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The most probable explanation of the passage is that it is an attempt to account for a discrepancy between the earlier and later ritual. That the priests should abstain, in the contemplated case, from eating the victim whose blood had not been brought into the sanctuary, was opposed to the later custom, and thus needed special circumstances to justify it, and the consequent sanction of Moses.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the directions occasioned by this judgment of God, Moses reminded Aaron and his sons of the general laws concerning the consumption of the priests' portions of the sacrifices, and their relation to the existing circumstances: first of all (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-12.htm">Leviticus 10:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-13.htm">Leviticus 10:13</a>), of the law relating to the eating of the meat-offering, which belonged to the priests after the azcarah had been lifted off (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-9.htm">Leviticus 6:9-11</a>), and then (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-14.htm">Leviticus 10:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-15.htm">Leviticus 10:15</a>) of that relating to the wave-breast and heave-leg (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-32.htm">Leviticus 7:32-34</a>). By the minchah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-12.htm">Leviticus 10:12</a> we are to understand the meal and oil, which were offered with the burnt-offering of the nation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-4.htm">Leviticus 9:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-7.htm">Leviticus 9:7</a>); and by the &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-12.htm">Leviticus 10:12</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-15.htm">Leviticus 10:15</a>, those portions of the burnt-offering, meat-offering, and peace-offering of the nation which were burned upon the altar (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-13.htm">Leviticus 9:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-17.htm">Leviticus 9:17</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-20.htm">Leviticus 9:20</a>). He then looked for "the he-goat of the sin-offering," - i.e., the flesh of the goat which had been brought for a sin-offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-15.htm">Leviticus 9:15</a>), and which was to have been eaten by the priests in the holy place along with the sin-offerings, whose blood was not taken into the sanctuary (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-19.htm">Leviticus 6:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-22.htm">Leviticus 6:22</a>); - "and, behold, it was burned" (&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1507;,   3 perf. Pual). Moses was angry at this, and reproved Eleazar and Ithamar, who had attended to the burning: "Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in a holy place?" he said; "for it is most holy, and He (Jehovah) hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for it before Jehovah," as its blood had not been brought into the holy place (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; construed as a passive with an accusative, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/4-18.htm">Genesis 4:18</a>, etc.). "To bear the iniquity" does not signify here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>, to bear and atone for the sin in its consequences, but, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a>, to take the sin of another upon one's self, for the purpose of cancelling it, to make expiation for it. As, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a>, the high priest was to appear before the Lord with the diadem upon his forehead, as the symbol of the holiness of his office, to cancel, as the mediator of the nation and by virtue of his official holiness, the sin which adhered to the holy gifts of the nation (see the note on this passage), so here it is stated with regard to the official eating of the most holy flesh of the sin-offering, which had been enjoined upon the priests, that they were thereby to bear the sin of the congregation, to make atonement for it. This effect or signification could only be ascribed to the eating, by its being regarded as an incorporation of the victim laden with sin, whereby the priests actually took away the sin by virtue of the holiness and sanctifying power belonging to their office, and not merely declared it removed, as Oehler explains the words (Herzog's Cycl. x. p. 649). <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a> is decisive in opposition to the declaratory view, which does not embrace the meaning of the words, and is not applicable to the passage at all. "Incorporabant quasi peccatum populique reatum in se recipiebant" (Deyling observv. ss. i. 45, 2).<p>(Note: C. a Lapide has given this correct interpretation of the passage: "ut scilicet cum hostiis populi pro peccato simul etiam populi peccata in vos quasi recipiatis, ut illa expietis." There is no foundation for the objection offered by Oehler, that the actual removal of guilt and the atonement itself were effected by the offering of the blood. For it by no means follows from <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, that the blood, as the soul of the sacrificial animal, covered or expiated the soul of the sinner, and that the removal and extinction of the sin had already taken place with the covering of the soul before the holy God, which involved the forgiveness of the sin and the reception of the sinner to mercy.) </body></html>
