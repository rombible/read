On the one was engraved the words “For Jehovah,” and on the other “For Azazel,” the expression in the original, which is translated <span class= "ital">scapegoat </span>in the Authorised Version. The high priest, after shaking the chest, put both his hands into the urn and simultaneously took out the two tablets, one in each hand. Hereupon he put the tablet which he had in his right hand upon the goat that was standing on his right side, whilst the tablet in his left hand he put on the goat on his left side. If the tablet with the in scription “For Jehovah was in his right hand the chief priest who stood at the right of the pontiff exclaimed “Hold up thy right hand on high!” and if it happened to be in the left hand, the chief of the principal household, who stood on his left, called out to him “Hold up thy left hand.” Hereupon the high priest laid the two lots on the two goats, the one in the right hand on the goat at his right, and the one in the left hand on the animal at his left, exclaiming at the same time, “To the Lord a sin offering!”<p><span class= "bld">And the other lot for the scapegoat.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">and the other lot for Azazel. </span>The word, which only occurs in this chapter, probably denotes the utterly banished demon, the prince of the evil spirits, who with his legions occupies the desert regions and desolated places. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm" title="But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-14.htm" title="The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.">Isaiah 34:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-43.htm" title="When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.">Matthew 12:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-24.htm" title="When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he said, I will return to my house from where I came out.">Luke 11:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-2.htm" title="And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.">Revelation 18:2</a>.) As the removal or pardon of sin is often represented in the Bible by its being banished into the uttermost parts of the earth and seas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-19.htm" title="He will turn again, he will have compassion on us; he will subdue our iniquities; and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.">Micah 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-12.htm" title="As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.">Psalm 103:12</a>), nothing could be more striking or convey to the people the idea of absolute forgiveness better than this symbolical act of sending the goat laden with the sins of the congregation to the wilderness, the abode of the prince of darkness, back to the author of all sin. The rendering, <span class= "ital">scapegoat, </span>is contrary to the manifest antithesis of the verse. If the one member “For Jehovah” denotes a person, the second member “For Azazel,” which forms the contrast, must, <span class= "ital">primâ facie, </span>also denote a person. Besides, the translation <span class= "ital">scapegoat </span>cannot be admitted in the next verse but one, where, if adopted, it would literally be “to send the goat to the scapegoat in the wilderness” .(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-10.htm" title="But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.">Leviticus 16:10</a>), or in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-26.htm" title="And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.">Leviticus 16:26</a>, where it is, “and he who taketh away the goat to the scapegoat.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-8.htm" title="And Aaron shall cast lots on the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.">Leviticus 16:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">One lot for the Lord — </span>To be sacrificed to him upon his altar.

As long as we are continually sinning, we continually need the atonement. The law of afflicting our souls for sin, is a statue which will continue in force till we arrive where all tears, even those of repentance, will be wiped from our eyes. The apostle observes it as a proof that the sacrifices could not take away sin, and cleanse the conscience from it, that in them there was a remembrance made of sin every year, upon the day of atonement, Heb 10:1,3. The repeating the sacrifices, showed there was in them but a feeble effort toward making atonement; this could be done only by offering up the body of Christ once for all; and that sacrifice needed not to be repeated.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The two goats formed a single sin-offering, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-5.htm">Leviticus 16:5</a>. To bring out the meaning of the sacrifice it was necessary that the act of a living being should be performed after death. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-22.htm">Leviticus 16:22</a> note. As this could not possibly be visibly set forth with a single victim, two were employed, as in the case of the birds in the rite for the healed leper <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4-6</a>.<p>For the scapegoat - Rather, for Azazel. The word occurs nowhere else in the Old Testament but in this chapter, and is probably derived from a root in use in Arabic, but not in Hebrew, signifying to "remove", or "to separate".<p>Azazel is the pre-Mosaic name of an evil personal being placed in opposition to Yahweh. Each goat, having been presented to Yahweh before the lots were cast, stood in a sacrificial relation to Him. The casting of lots was an appeal to the decision of Yahweh (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-16.htm">Joshua 7:16-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-2.htm">Joshua 14:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>, etc.); it was therefore His act to choose one of the goats for His service in the way of ordinary sacrifice, the other for His service in carrying off the sins to Azazel (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-22.htm">Leviticus 16:22</a>). By this exppressive outward sign the sins were sent back to the author of sin himself, "the entirely separate one," who was banished from the realm of grace.<p>The goat itself did not lose the sacred character with which it had been endued in being presented before Yahweh. It was, as much as the slain goat, a figure of Him who bore our griefs and carried our sorrows, on whom the Lord laid the iniquity of us all <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>, that we might become a sanctified Church to be presented unto Himself, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26-27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-10. shall take of the congregation &#8230; two kids of the goats &#8230; and one ram&#8212;The sacrifices were to be offered by the high priest, respectively for himself and the other priests, as well as for the people. The bullock (Le 16:3) and the goats were for sin offerings and the rams for burnt offerings. The goats, though used in different ways, constituted only one offering. They were both presented before the Lord, and the disposal of them determined by lot, which Jewish writers have thus described: The priest, placing one of the goats on his right hand and the other on his left, took his station by the altar, and cast into an urn two pieces of gold exactly similar, inscribed, the one with the words "for the Lord," and the other for "Azazel" (the scapegoat). After having well shaken them together, he put both his hands into the box and took up a lot in each: that in his right hand he put on the head of the goat which stood on his right, and that in his left he dropped on the other. In this manner the fate of each was decided.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">One lot for the Lord; </span> for the Lord’s use and service by way of sacrifice.

Which should be slain, and which should be kept alive, and let go: the manner of casting lots, according to the Misnah (a), was this; the high priest went to the east of the court, to the north of the altar, the Sagan (or deputy priest) at his right hand, and Rosh Beth Ab (or the chief of the house of the fathers) on his left hand, and the two goats were there; and there was a vessel (box or urn, called Calphi), and in it were two lots of box tree: the high priest shook the Calphi (or urn) and took out the two lots; one, on which was written, "for the Lord", and the other, on which was written, "for Azazel"; if that came up on the right hand, the Sagan said to him, my lord high priest, lift up thy right hand on high; and if that on the left hand came up, Rosh Beth Ab said to him, my lord high priest, lift up thy left hand on high: he put them upon the two goats and said, a sin offering for the Lord; and they answered after him, blessed be the Lord, may the glory of his kingdom be for ever and ever: now these lots, as Ben Gersom observes, were alike, not one greater than another; and they were of the same matter, for if one had been of stone and the other of wood, they might, have been known by feeling, and so the lots would not have been legal: and the same is observed by Maimonides (b), that though they might be of any matter, of wood, or stone, or metal, yet one might not be great, and the other small, and the one of silver, and the other of gold, but both alike, for the reason before given: <p>one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat: one had written upon it, as in the above account, "for the Lord"; and the other had written upon it, "for Azazel"; directing that the goat on which the lot for the Lord fell was to be slain and offered up for a sin offering to him; and the other, on which the lot for Azazel fell, was to be kept alive and let go: now, however casual and contingent the casting of a lot may seem to men, it is certain to God, the disposal of it is of him, and according to his determination, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>; and this, in the mystical sense, here denotes, that the sufferings and death of Christ were according to the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, and so were foretold in the Scriptures, and came to pass according to his appointment, will, and command, as was also his resurrection from the dead, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-23.htm">Acts 1:23</a>; and likewise his conflict with Satan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-30.htm">John 14:30</a>. <p>(a) Misn.

The death of Aaron's sons, as a punishment for wilfully "drawing near before Jehovah," was to be a solemn warning to Aaron himself, "not to come at all times into the holy place within the vail, before the mercy-seat upon the ark," i.e., into the most holy place (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10</a>.), but only at the time to be appointed by Jehovah, and for the purposes instituted by Him, i.e., according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29</a>., only once a year, on the day of atonement, and only in the manner prescribed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-3.htm">Leviticus 16:3</a>., that he might not die. - "For I will appear in the cloud above the capporeth." The cloud in which Jehovah appeared above the capporeth, between the cherubim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>), was not the cloud of the incense, with which Aaron was to cover the capporeth on entering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-13.htm">Leviticus 16:13</a>), as Vitringa, Bhr, and others follow the Sadducees in supposing, but the cloud of the divine glory, in which Jehovah manifested His essential presence in the most holy place above the ark of the covenant. Because Jehovah appeared in this cloud, not only could no unclean and sinful man go before the capporeth, i.e., approach the holiness of the all-holy God; but even the anointed and sanctified high priest, if he went before it at his own pleasure, or without the expiatory blood of sacrifice, would expose himself to certain death. The reason for this prohibition is to be found in the fact, that the holiness communicated to the priest did not cancel the sin of his nature, but only covered it over for the performance of his official duties, and so long as the law, which produced only the knowledge of sin and not its forgiveness and removal, was not abolished by the complete atonement, the holy God was and remained to mortal and sinful man a consuming fire, before which no one could stand. </body></html>
