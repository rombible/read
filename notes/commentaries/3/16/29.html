This is expressed by the fuller form, “to afflict the soul with fasting.” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-13.htm" title="But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into my own bosom.">Psalm 35:13</a>, where the Authorised Version inconsistently translates it, “humbled my soul.” This is the only public fast ordained in the Mosaic Law; and the authorities during the second Temple defined more minutely in what this fasting consists. According to the canon law it consists not only in abstaining from eating and drinking, but from washing, anointing, wearing of shoes or sandals, and the marriage-bed, as they were the outward signs of joy. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-10.htm" title="Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, where you go.">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a>.) If any one presumptuously ate as much as a date with a kernel, or drank as much as fills one cheek, he violated the Law, and incurred the penalty of excision. If he did it unintentionally he had to bring a sin offering. The fast lasted from evening to evening, and is rigorously kept by Jews to this day. Exception was and still is made in the case of pregnant women, invalids, and children. This is the fast which the Apostle refers to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-9.htm" title="Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,">Acts 27:9</a>. The marginal note on this passage, viz., “the fast was on the tenth day of the seventh month” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-27.htm" title="Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation to you; and you shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-29.htm" title="For whatever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.">Leviticus 23:29</a>), is not to be found in the first edition of the Authorised Version. It was introduced by Bishop Lloyd in the Bible published in London, 1701, fol., who took it from the Geneva Version (Geneva, 1560), and it was adopted in the Oxford 4to edition, 1703. When Christ admonishes his followers, “When thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-17.htm" title="But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;">Matthew 6:17</a>), He refers to the canonical law about fasting here given.<p><span class= "bld">And do no work at all.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">ye shall do no manner of work, </span>as the same phrase is rendered in the Authorised Version in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-31.htm" title="You shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.">Leviticus 23:31</a>. It is to be regretted that this legal phrase, which occurs five times in the Pentateuch, four of which are to be found in this very book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-29.htm" title="And this shall be a statute for ever to you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojournes among you:">Leviticus 16:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-3.htm" title="Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; you shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.">Leviticus 23:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-28.htm" title="And you shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.">Leviticus 23:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-31.htm" title="You shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.">Leviticus 23:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-7.htm" title="And you shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy convocation; and you shall afflict your souls: you shall not do any work therein:">Numbers 29:7</a>), should have been translated differently in the Authorised Version. This variation is all the more glaring in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-7.htm" title="And you shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy convocation; and you shall afflict your souls: you shall not do any work therein:">Numbers 29:7</a>, which is the parallel passage to this. The day was to be a rest from all manual and other secular work exactly as on the Sabbath, with this exception, that whilst work on the Sabbath was punished with stoning, labour on the Day of Atonement was punished with excision.<p><span class= "bld">A stranger that sojourneth among you.</span>—That is, one of non-Jewish descent who had renounced idolatry, and-voluntarily joined the Jewish community.

See the expiation of guilt. Christ is both the Maker and the Matter of the atonement; for he is the Priest, the High Priest, that makes reconciliation for the sins of the people. And as Christ is the High Priest, so he is the Sacrifice with which atonement is made; for he is all in all in our reconciliation to God. Thus he was figured by the two goats. The slain goat was a type of Christ dying for our sins; the scape-goat a type of Christ rising again for our justification. The atonement is said to be completed by putting the sins of Israel upon the head of the goat, which was sent away into a wilderness, a land not inhabited; and the sending away of the goat represented the free and full remission of their sins. He shall bear upon him all their iniquities. Thus Christ, the Lamb of God, takes away the sin of the world, by taking it upon himself, Joh 1:29. The entrance into heaven, which Christ made for us, was typified by the high priest's entrance into the most holy place. See Heb 9:7. The high priest was to come out again; but our Lord Jesus ever lives, making intercession, and always appears in the presence of God for us. Here are typified the two great gospel duties of faith and repentance. By faith we put our hands upon the head of the offering; relying on Christ as the Lord our Righteousness, pleading his satisfaction, as that which alone is able to atone for our sins, and procure us a pardon. By repentance we afflict our souls; not only fasting for a time from the delights of the body, but inwardly sorrowing for sin, and living a life of self-denial, assuring ourselves, that if we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. By the atonement we obtain rest for our souls, and all the glorious liberties of the children of God. Sinner, get the blood of Christ effectually applied to thy soul, or else thou canst never look God in the face with any comfort or acceptance. Take this blood of Christ, apply it by faith, and see how it atones with God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Seventh month, on the tenth day - The month Ethanim or Tisri, as being the seventh in the Sacred year, has been called the sabbatical month.

The Day of Atonement was the only public fast commanded by the Law of Moses. See further directions in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-27.htm">Leviticus 23:27-32</a>.

See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a> note. The meaning is, one of foreign blood, who dwelt with the Israelites, had abjured false gods, and had become familiarly known to his neighbors, e. g. the Kenites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11</a>, etc.); the Gibeonites <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9.htm">Joshua 9</a>; and a considerable portion of the "mixed multitude" (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48</a>).

All persons who performed any labor were subject to the penalty of death [Ex 31:14, 15; 35:2]. It took place on the tenth day of the seventh month, corresponding to our third of October; and this chapter, together with Le 23:27-32, as containing special allusion to the observances of the day, was publicly read. The rehearsal of these passages appointing the solemn ceremonial was very appropriate, and the details of the successive parts of it (above all the spectacle of the public departure of the scapegoat under the care of its leader) must have produced salutary impressions both of sin and of duty that would not be soon effaced.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For ever.</span> See on <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-14.htm" title="And this day shall be to you for a memorial; and you shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.">Exodus 12:14</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the seventh month, </span> answering part to our September, and part to our October; when they had gathered in all their fruits, and were most at leisure for God’s service: this time God chose for this and other feasts, herein graciously condescending to men’s necessities and conveniencies, being contented with that time which men could best spare. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">On the tenth day.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Object.</span> It was <span class="ital">on the ninth day</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-32.htm" title="It shall be to you a sabbath of rest, and you shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even to even, shall you celebrate your sabbath.">Leviticus 23:32</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> It began in the evening of the ninth day, and continued till the evening of the tenth day, as is there sufficiently implied. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ye shall afflict your souls, </span> i.e. yourselves, as the word soul is frequently used, both your bodies by abstinence from food and other delights, and your minds by anguish and grief for former sins, which though bitter, yet is voluntarily in all true penitents, who are therefore here said not to be afflicted, but to afflict themselves, or to be active in the work. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And this shall be a statute for ever unto you,....

It was <span class="cmt_word">a sabbath of rest</span>; literally, a <span class="accented">sabbath of sabbatism.</span> The purpose of the abstinence from food and labour was to bring the soul of each individual into harmony with the solemn rites of purification publicly performed not by themselves, but by the high priest. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the living goat had been sent away, Aaron was to go into the tabernacle, i.e., the holy place of the dwelling, and there take off his white clothes and lay them down, i.e., put them away, because they were only to be worn in the performance of the expiatory ritual of this day, and then bathe his body in the holy place, i.e., in the court, in the laver between the altar and the door of the dwelling, probably because the act of laying the sins upon the goat rendered him unclean. He was then to put on his clothes, i.e., the coloured state-dress of the high priest, and to offer in this the burnt-offerings, for an atonement for himself and the nation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-4.htm">Leviticus 1:4</a>), and to burn the fat portions of the sin-offerings upon the altar. </body></html>
