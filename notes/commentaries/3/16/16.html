See the expiation of guilt. Christ is both the Maker and the Matter of the atonement; for he is the Priest, the High Priest, that makes reconciliation for the sins of the people. And as Christ is the High Priest, so he is the Sacrifice with which atonement is made; for he is all in all in our reconciliation to God. Thus he was figured by the two goats. The slain goat was a type of Christ dying for our sins; the scape-goat a type of Christ rising again for our justification. The atonement is said to be completed by putting the sins of Israel upon the head of the goat, which was sent away into a wilderness, a land not inhabited; and the sending away of the goat represented the free and full remission of their sins. He shall bear upon him all their iniquities. Thus Christ, the Lamb of God, takes away the sin of the world, by taking it upon himself, Joh 1:29. The entrance into heaven, which Christ made for us, was typified by the high priest's entrance into the most holy place. See Heb 9:7. The high priest was to come out again; but our Lord Jesus ever lives, making intercession, and always appears in the presence of God for us. Here are typified the two great gospel duties of faith and repentance. By faith we put our hands upon the head of the offering; relying on Christ as the Lord our Righteousness, pleading his satisfaction, as that which alone is able to atone for our sins, and procure us a pardon. By repentance we afflict our souls; not only fasting for a time from the delights of the body, but inwardly sorrowing for sin, and living a life of self-denial, assuring ourselves, that if we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. By the atonement we obtain rest for our souls, and all the glorious liberties of the children of God. Sinner, get the blood of Christ effectually applied to thy soul, or else thou canst never look God in the face with any comfort or acceptance. Take this blood of Christ, apply it by faith, and see how it atones with God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "holy place" - Here the place within the veil, the holy of holies.<p>Tabernacle of the congregation - tent of meeting. atonement was now to be made for the tabernacle as a whole. The sense is very briefly expressed, but there seems to be no room to doubt that the high priest was to sprinkle the blood of each of the victims before the altar of incense, as he had done before the mercy-seat within the veil; and also to touch with blood the horns of the altar of incense <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>.<p>That remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-19.htm">Leviticus 16:19</a>.

See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a> note.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-19. Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself, &c.&#8212;The first part of the service was designed to solemnize his own mind, as well as the minds of the people, by offering the sacrifices for their sins. The sin offerings being slain had the sins of the offerer judicially transferred to them by the imputation of his hands on their head (Le 4:4, 15, 24, 29, 33); and thus the young bullock, which was to make atonement for himself and the other priests (called "his house," Ps 135:19), was killed by the hands of the high priest. While the blood of the victim was being received into a vessel, taking a censer of live coals in his right hand and a platter of sweet incense in his left, he, amid the solemn attention and the anxious prayers of the assembled multitude, crossed the porch and the holy place, opened the outer veil which led into the holy of holies and then the inner veil. Standing before the ark, he deposited the censer of coals on the floor, emptied the plate of incense into his hand, poured it on the burning coals; and the apartment was filled with fragrant smoke, intended, according to Jewish writers, to prevent any presumptuous gazer prying too curiously into the form of the mercy seat, which was the Lord's throne. The high priest having done this, perfumed the sanctuary, returned to the door, took the blood of the slain bullock, and, carrying it into the holy of holies, sprinkled it with his finger once upon the mercy seat "eastward"&#8212;that is, on the side next to himself; and seven times "before the mercy seat"&#8212;that is, on the front of the ark. Leaving the coals and the incense burning, he went out a second time, to sacrifice at the altar of burnt offering the goat which had been assigned as a sin offering for the people; and carrying its blood into the holy of holies, he made similar sprinklings as he had done before with the blood of the bullock. While the high priest was thus engaged in the most holy place, none of the ordinary priests were allowed to remain within the precincts of the tabernacle. The sanctuary or holy place and the altar of burnt offering were in like manner sprinkled seven times with the blood of the bullock and the goat. The object of this solemn ceremonial was to impress the minds of the Israelites with the conviction that the whole tabernacle was stained by the sins of a guilty people, that by their sins they had forfeited the privileges of the divine presence and worship, and that an atonement had to be made as the condition of God's remaining with them. The sins and shortcomings of the past year having polluted the sacred edifice, the expiation required to be annually renewed. The exclusion of the priests indicated their unworthiness and the impurities of their service. The mingled blood of the two victims being sprinkled on the horns of the altar indicated that the priests and the people equally needed an atonement for their sins. But the sanctuary being thus ceremonially purified, and the people of Israel reconciled by the blood of the consecrated victim, the Lord continued to dwell in the midst of them, and to honor them with His gracious presence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">An atonement for the holy place; </span> of which see below, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-19.htm" title="And he shall sprinkle of the blood on it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.">Leviticus 16:19</a>,20 Exo 29:36 <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-15.htm" title="And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation on it.">Leviticus 8:15</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-13.htm" title="For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh:">Hebrews 9:13</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel; </span> for though the people did not enter into that place, yet their sins entered thither, and would hinder the effects of the high priest’s mediation on their behalf, if God was not reconciled to them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the midst of their uncleanness; </span> encompassed with their sins, being in the midst of a sinful people, who defile not themselves only, but also God’s sanctuary, as God complains, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-38.htm" title="Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.">Ezekiel 23:38</a>,39</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he shall make an atonement for the holy place,.... Even the holy of holies, as Aben Ezra interprets it, into which the high priest entered with blood for that purpose; the Targum of Jonathan adds, by a verbal confession, that is, of sin; but atonement was not made in that way, but by the blood of the bullock and goat, which was sprinkled towards the mercy seat, above and below: and this was made <p>because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins; which heap of words shows how many and heinous the sins of the people of Israel were, being defections from God, rebellions against him, transgressions of his law, and which brought pollution and guilt upon them, which could only be expiated by blood; and though the people of Israel did not enter so much as into the holy place, where the priests at times went, and much less into the holiest of all, yet their sins in some sense entered there, and came before the Lord that dwelt there; as the sins of men do even reach up to heaven itself, and cry for wrath and vengeance: and so made the Israelites unworthy of such a favour as for the Lord to dwell among them in that most holy place, in so solemn a manner; and for their high priest to enter there, and consult the oracle of God for them, and make intercession on their account, to which atonement was necessary; even as men by their sins render themselves unworthy of entering into the heavenly state, nor can they, without the atonement and sacrifice of Christ; and to this purification of the patterns of heavenly things; and of the heavenly things or places themselves, the apostle refers, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-23.htm">Hebrews 9:23</a>, <p>and shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation that remaineth among them, in the midst of their uncleanness; that is, the court of the tabernacle where the Israelites were admitted, and where they often came in their uncleanness, either ignorantly or presumptuously, and yet notwithstanding the tabernacle remained among them; but, it was necessary that atonement should be made for the uncleanness in it, and around it, that it might continue, and they might have the privilege of coming into it, and worshipping in it. This shows that there are sins of holy things, and which attend the most solemn service, which are committed in the sanctuary of the Lord, and while waiting upon him in his house and ordinances; which must be expiated and removed. The same rites were observed, in making the atonement for this part of the sanctuary, as for the most holy place, particularly by sprinkling the blood in like manner, only, elsewhere; so says Jarchi, as he sprinkled of them both within, that is, of the blood of the bullock, and of the goat, within the vail, once above, and seven times below; so he sprinkled, by the vail without, of both of them, once above, and seven times below. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he shall make an atonement for the holy <i>place</i>, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.</span><p>(e) Placed among them who are unclean.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/leviticus/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16, 17</span>. <span class="ital">for</span> (<span class="ital">in</span>) <span class="ital">the holy place</span>] by ‘the holy place,’ here distinguished from the ‘tent of meeting’ as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-20.htm" title="And when he has made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat:">Leviticus 16:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-23.htm" title="And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:">Leviticus 16:23</a></span>, is meant the Holy of Holies, and so in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/16-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Speak to Aaron your brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil before the mercy seat, which is on the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud on the mercy seat....">Leviticus 16:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-27.htm" title="And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.">Leviticus 16:27</a></span>.

Accordingly, the high priest proceeds to do <span class="cmt_word">so for the tabernacle of the congregation,</span> that is, to make a similar atonement by similar means outside the vail as he had made inside it. He would therefore have made one sprinkling with the blood upon the vail, and seven sprinklings before it, after which he placed the blood upon the horns of the altar of incense, according to the command given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>. In later times it became customary also to sprinkle the top of the altar of incense seven times. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With the bullock Aaron was to make atonement for himself and his house. The two he-goats he was to place before Jehovah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>), and "give lots over them," i.e., have lots cast upon them, one lot for Jehovah, the other for Azazel. The one upon which the lot for Jehovah fell (&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, from the coming up of the lot out of the urn, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-11.htm">Joshua 18:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-10.htm">Joshua 19:10</a>), he was to prepare as a sin-offering for Jehovah, and to present the one upon which the lot for Azazel fell alive before Jehovah, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1500;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;, "to expiate it," i.e., to make it the object of expiation (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-21.htm">Leviticus 16:21</a>), to send it (them) into the desert to Azazel. &#1506;&#1494;&#1488;&#1494;&#1500;, which only occurs in this chapter, signifies neither "a remote solitude," nor any locality in the desert whatever (as Jonathan, Rashi, etc., suppose); nor the "he-goat" (from &#1506;&#1494; goat, and &#1506;&#1494;&#1500; to turn off, "the goat departing or sent away," as Symm., Theodot., the Vulgate, Luther, and others render it); nor "complete removal" (Bhr, Winer, Tholuck, etc.). The words, one lot for Jehovah and one for Azazel, require unconditionally that Azazel should be regarded as a personal being, in opposition to Jehovah. The word is a more intense form of &#1506;&#1494;&#1500; removit, dimovit, and comes from &#1506;&#1494;&#1500;&#1494;&#1500; by absorbing the liquid, like Babel from balbel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-9.htm">Genesis 11:9</a>), and Golgotha from gulgalta (Ewald, 158c). The Septuagint rendering is correct, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; although in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-10.htm">Leviticus 16:10</a> the rendering &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#769; is also adopted, i.e., "averruncus, a fiend, or demon whom one drives away" (Ewald). We have not to think, however, of any demon whatever, who seduces men to wickedness in the form of an evil spirit, as the fallen angel Azazel is represented as doing in the Jewish writings (Book of Enoch 8:1; 10:10; 13:1ff.), like the terrible field Shibe, whom the Arabs of the peninsula of Sinai so much dread (Seetzen, i. pp. 273-4), but of the devil himself, the head of the fallen angels, who was afterwards called Satan; for no subordinate evil spirit could have been placed in antithesis to Jehovah as Azazel is here, but only the ruler or head of the kingdom of demons. The desert and desolate places are mentioned elsewhere as the abode of evil spirits (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-14.htm">Isaiah 34:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-43.htm">Matthew 12:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-24.htm">Luke 11:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2</a>). The desert, regarded as an image of death and desolation, corresponds to the nature of evil spirits, who fell away from the primary source of life, and in their hostility to God devastated the world, which was created good, and brought death and destruction in their train. </body></html>
