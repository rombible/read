As long as we are continually sinning, we continually need the atonement. The law of afflicting our souls for sin, is a statue which will continue in force till we arrive where all tears, even those of repentance, will be wiped from our eyes. The apostle observes it as a proof that the sacrifices could not take away sin, and cleanse the conscience from it, that in them there was a remembrance made of sin every year, upon the day of atonement, Heb 10:1,3. The repeating the sacrifices, showed there was in them but a feeble effort toward making atonement; this could be done only by offering up the body of Christ once for all; and that sacrifice needed not to be repeated.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is important, in reference to the meaning of the day of atonement, to observe the order of the rites as they are described in these verses.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-19. Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself, &c.&#8212;The first part of the service was designed to solemnize his own mind, as well as the minds of the people, by offering the sacrifices for their sins. The sin offerings being slain had the sins of the offerer judicially transferred to them by the imputation of his hands on their head (Le 4:4, 15, 24, 29, 33); and thus the young bullock, which was to make atonement for himself and the other priests (called "his house," Ps 135:19), was killed by the hands of the high priest. While the blood of the victim was being received into a vessel, taking a censer of live coals in his right hand and a platter of sweet incense in his left, he, amid the solemn attention and the anxious prayers of the assembled multitude, crossed the porch and the holy place, opened the outer veil which led into the holy of holies and then the inner veil. Standing before the ark, he deposited the censer of coals on the floor, emptied the plate of incense into his hand, poured it on the burning coals; and the apartment was filled with fragrant smoke, intended, according to Jewish writers, to prevent any presumptuous gazer prying too curiously into the form of the mercy seat, which was the Lord's throne. The high priest having done this, perfumed the sanctuary, returned to the door, took the blood of the slain bullock, and, carrying it into the holy of holies, sprinkled it with his finger once upon the mercy seat "eastward"&#8212;that is, on the side next to himself; and seven times "before the mercy seat"&#8212;that is, on the front of the ark. Leaving the coals and the incense burning, he went out a second time, to sacrifice at the altar of burnt offering the goat which had been assigned as a sin offering for the people; and carrying its blood into the holy of holies, he made similar sprinklings as he had done before with the blood of the bullock. While the high priest was thus engaged in the most holy place, none of the ordinary priests were allowed to remain within the precincts of the tabernacle. The sanctuary or holy place and the altar of burnt offering were in like manner sprinkled seven times with the blood of the bullock and the goat. The object of this solemn ceremonial was to impress the minds of the Israelites with the conviction that the whole tabernacle was stained by the sins of a guilty people, that by their sins they had forfeited the privileges of the divine presence and worship, and that an atonement had to be made as the condition of God's remaining with them. The sins and shortcomings of the past year having polluted the sacred edifice, the expiation required to be annually renewed. The exclusion of the priests indicated their unworthiness and the impurities of their service. The mingled blood of the two victims being sprinkled on the horns of the altar indicated that the priests and the people equally needed an atonement for their sins. But the sanctuary being thus ceremonially purified, and the people of Israel reconciled by the blood of the consecrated victim, the Lord continued to dwell in the midst of them, and to honor them with His gracious presence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The bullock, </span> mentioned in general <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-6.htm" title="And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.">Leviticus 16:6</a></span>; the ceremonies whereof are here particularly described.

According to the Mishna (Tal. Bab. <span class="ital">Yoma</span>), the high priest on presenting his bullock (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-6.htm" title="And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.">Leviticus 16:6</a></span>) made a confession of sin to which the people answered ‘Blessed be the Name of the glory of His Kingdom for ever and ever.’ He cast lots upon the goats, and declared which was for the Lord, and they answered ‘Blessed be the Name, etc.’ (fol. 39 <span class="ital">a</span>). He put a tongue-shaped piece of scarlet wool upon the head of the goat to be sent away, and came beside his bullock (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-11.htm" title="And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself:">Leviticus 16:11</a></span>) the second time and repeated his confession, and they answered ‘Blessed be the Name, etc’ (41<span class="ital">b</span>). He killed the bullock, and caught the blood in a bowl; he took the censer and put burning coals from the altar in it (43<span class="ital">b</span>). They brought him the cup and the censer; he filled his hands with incense and put it into the cup; he took the censer in his right hand and the cup in his left (47<span class="ital">a</span>), and went into the temple, and when he came to the altar, he heaped the incense on the burning coals and the whole house was filled with smoke; he returned, and offered a short prayer in the outer house, but did not prolong it, lest (by a lengthy absence) he should cause terror in Israel (51<span class="ital">b</span>, 52<span class="ital">b</span>). In the second temple the high priest placed the censer on a stone in the Holy of Holies, called ‘foundation, which was three fingers high. [There was no altar in the second temple.] He took the blood of the bullock and returned within the veil, and sprinkled of it once upwards and seven times downwards; he went out and placed the bowl on a column in the sanctuary. He then killed the goat, and brought the blood within the veil, and sprinkled it as he did with the blood of the bullock; he went out and placed the bowl on a column in the sanctuary [tradition varies as to whether the column was the same as that on which the bowl containing the bullock’s blood had been placed]; he then sprinkled the blood of the bullock on the veil on the outside, and afterwards the blood of the goat, both sprinklings being once upwards and seven times downwards, as he sprinkled the blood within the veil; he then mixed the blood of the bullock with that of the goat (53<span class="ital">b</span>), and went out to the altar that is ‘before the Lord,’ the golden altar [but cp. note on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-18.htm" title="And he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar round about.">Leviticus 16:18</a></span>], and began cleansing it; he sprinkled on the middle [the clean place] of the altar seven times, and some of the remainder of the blood he poured out on the western base of the outer altar [the altar of Burnt-Offering] and the remainder of the blood he poured out on the southern base of that altar (58<span class="ital">b</span>). If the high priest did not perform the work of the Day of Atonement in the prescribed order, it was invalid (60<span class="ital">b</span>). Concerning the two goats for the Day of Atonement, it is commanded that they should be alike in colour, height, and price, with provision in the event of one of the goats dying (61<span class="ital">b</span>). The high priest placed his two hands on the goat to be sent away, and said (Tal. Bab. <span class="ital">Yoma</span>, 66<span class="ital">a</span>): O Lord, Thy people the house of Israel have committed iniquity, and transgressed, and sinned before Thee. O Lord pardon now the iniquities, the transgressions, and the sins which Thy people, the house of Israel, have iniquitously done, transgressed, and sinned before Thee, as it is written in the law of Moses Thy servant, ‘For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall ye be clean before the Lord’ (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-30.htm" title="For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that you may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.">Leviticus 16:30</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And the priests and the people when they heard the Name from the mouth of the priest, bowed, and worshipped, and fell on their faces and said, ‘Blessed be the Name, etc.’ (66<span class="ital">a</span>). The goat was conducted to a place called <span class="ital">Ẓôḳ</span>, about 12 miles from Jerusalem (66<span class="ital">b</span>), where it was thrown backwards from the edge of a cliff. Booths were placed at the end of each of the first ten miles; the nobles of Jerusalem accompanied the goat to the first booth, and the rest of the people as far as the last booth from which they watched the actions of the man who took charge of the goat. Watchmen made signals when the goat arrived at the edge of the wilderness, and its arrival was thus made known to the high priest (67<span class="ital">a</span>, 68<span class="ital">b</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This treatise, though it contains many additional directions not found in Scripture, throws light on some parts of the Biblical account. It makes clear the occasions on which the high priest enters the Most Holy place: (1) he goes in with the censer and the incense as ordered in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/16-12.htm" title="And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:...">Leviticus 16:12-13</a></span>; (2) after going out to fetch the blood of the bullock he enters the Most Holy place the <span class="ital">second time</span> (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-14.htm" title="And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.">Leviticus 16:14</a></span>); he then kills the goat, the Sin-Offering of the people; and (3) enters the Most Holy place the <span class="ital">third</span> time with the blood of the goat (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-15.htm" title="Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:">Leviticus 16:15</a></span>). It also mentions the mixing of the blood of the bullock with that of the goat, which seems implied in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-18.htm" title="And he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar round about.">Leviticus 16:18</a></span>.

He was to bring an ox (bullock) for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering, as a sacrifice for himself and his house (i.e., the priesthood, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-6.htm">Leviticus 16:6</a>), and two he-goats for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering, as a sacrifice for the congregation. For this purpose he was to put on, not the state-costume of the high priest, but a body-coat, drawers, girdle, and head-dress of white cloth (bad: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a>), having first bathed his body, and not merely his hands and feet, as he did for the ordinary service, to appear before Jehovah as entirely cleansed from the defilement of sin (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a>) and arrayed in clothes of holiness. The dress of white cloth was not the plain official dress of the ordinary priests, for the girdle of that dress was coloured (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39-40</a>); and in that case the high priest would not have appeared in the perfect purity of his divinely appointed office as chief of the priesthood, but simply as the priest appointed for this day (v. Hoffmann). Nor did he officiate (as many of the Rabbins, and also C. a Lapide, Grotius, Rosenmller, and Knobel suppose) as a penitent praying humbly for the forgiveness of sin. For where in all the world have clear white clothes been worn either in mourning or as a penitential garment? The emphatic expression, "these are holy garments," is a sufficient proof that the pure white colour of all the clothes, even of the girdle, was intended as a representation of holiness. Although in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4</a>, etc., the official dress not only of Aaron, but of his sons also, that is to say, the priestly costume generally, is described as "holy garments," yet in the present chapter the word kodesh, "holy," is frequently used in an emphatic sense (for example, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-3.htm">Leviticus 16:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-16.htm">Leviticus 16:16</a>, of the most holy place of the dwelling), and by this predicate the dress is characterized as most holy. Moreover, it was in baddim ("linen") that the angel of Jehovah was clothed (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2-3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-11.htm">Ezekiel 9:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-6.htm">Ezekiel 10:6-7</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-6.htm">Daniel 12:6-7</a>), whose whole appearance, as described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>, resembled the appearance of the glory of Jehovah, which Ezekiel saw in the vision of the four cherubim (ch. 1), and was almost exactly like the glory of Jesus Christ, which John saw in the Revelation (<a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13-15</a>). The white material, therefore, of the dress which Aaron wore, when performing the highest act of expiation under the Old Testament, was a symbolical shadowing forth of the holiness and glory of the one perfect Mediator between God and man, who, being the radiation of the glory of God and the image of His nature, effected by Himself the perfect cleansing away of our sin, and who, as the true High Priest, being holy, innocent, unspotted, and separate from sinners, entered once by His own blood into the holy place not made with hands, namely, into heaven itself, to appear before the face of God for us, and obtain everlasting redemption (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>). </body></html>
