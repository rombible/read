(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-15.htm" title="Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:">Leviticus 16:15</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-14 Without entering into particulars of the sacrifices on the great day of atonement, we may notice that it was to be a statute for ever, till that dispensation be at an end. As long as we are continually sinning, we continually need the atonement. The law of afflicting our souls for sin, is a statue which will continue in force till we arrive where all tears, even those of repentance, will be wiped from our eyes. The apostle observes it as a proof that the sacrifices could not take away sin, and cleanse the conscience from it, that in them there was a remembrance made of sin every year, upon the day of atonement, Heb 10:1,3. The repeating the sacrifices, showed there was in them but a feeble effort toward making atonement; this could be done only by offering up the body of Christ once for all; and that sacrifice needed not to be repeated.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The two goats formed a single sin-offering, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-5.htm">Leviticus 16:5</a>. To bring out the meaning of the sacrifice it was necessary that the act of a living being should be performed after death. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-22.htm">Leviticus 16:22</a> note. As this could not possibly be visibly set forth with a single victim, two were employed, as in the case of the birds in the rite for the healed leper <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4-6</a>.<p>For the scapegoat - Rather, for Azazel. The word occurs nowhere else in the Old Testament but in this chapter, and is probably derived from a root in use in Arabic, but not in Hebrew, signifying to "remove", or "to separate".<p>Azazel is the pre-Mosaic name of an evil personal being placed in opposition to Yahweh. Each goat, having been presented to Yahweh before the lots were cast, stood in a sacrificial relation to Him. The casting of lots was an appeal to the decision of Yahweh (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-16.htm">Joshua 7:16-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-2.htm">Joshua 14:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>, etc.); it was therefore His act to choose one of the goats for His service in the way of ordinary sacrifice, the other for His service in carrying off the sins to Azazel (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-22.htm">Leviticus 16:22</a>). By this exppressive outward sign the sins were sent back to the author of sin himself, "the entirely separate one," who was banished from the realm of grace.<p>The goat itself did not lose the sacred character with which it had been endued in being presented before Yahweh. It was, as much as the slain goat, a figure of Him who bore our griefs and carried our sorrows, on whom the Lord laid the iniquity of us all <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>, that we might become a sanctified Church to be presented unto Himself, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26-27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-10. shall take of the congregation &#8230; two kids of the goats &#8230; and one ram&#8212;The sacrifices were to be offered by the high priest, respectively for himself and the other priests, as well as for the people. The bullock (Le 16:3) and the goats were for sin offerings and the rams for burnt offerings. The goats, though used in different ways, constituted only one offering. They were both presented before the Lord, and the disposal of them determined by lot, which Jewish writers have thus described: The priest, placing one of the goats on his right hand and the other on his left, took his station by the altar, and cast into an urn two pieces of gold exactly similar, inscribed, the one with the words "for the Lord," and the other for "Azazel" (the scapegoat). After having well shaken them together, he put both his hands into the box and took up a lot in each: that in his right hand he put on the head of the goat which stood on his right, and that in his left he dropped on the other. In this manner the fate of each was decided.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> So the lot is said to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">fall, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-7.htm" title="And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is on us.

Alluding to the manner of taking out the lot by the high priest, who, when he took it out, lifted it up with his hand, and then let it down, and put it on the head of the goat; after which he brought it to the altar to be sacrificed: <p>and offer him for a sin offering; an offering for the sins of the people, as a type of Christ, who made his soul an offering for sin for his people; but this was not done by Aaron until he had brought and killed the sin offering for himself; after which we read of killing this sin offering for the people, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-11.htm">Leviticus 16:11</a>; wherefore some take this offering here to be no other than a setting apart or devoting the goat for this service. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - These verses might be translated as follows: - <span class="accented">And Aaron shall bring in the goat upon which the lot for the Lord fell, and shall offer him for a sin offering. But the goat, upon which fell the lot for a remover of sins, shall be presented alive before the Lord, to make an atonement with him, and to send him away for a remover of sins into the wilderness.</span> We are justified in inserting the words, "of sins," after "a remover," because "the use of the word <span class="accented">azal</span>, from which the word rendered by 'remover' is derived, is confined in the Hebrew dialect to the single purpose or institution which is here under consideration; so that this particular word must have conveyed to the mind of a Hebrew hearer or reader this notion of a removal of <span class="accented">sins</span>, and none other" (Sir W. Martin, 'Semitic Languages'). The goat is both <span class="cmt_word">presented before the Lord,</span> and subsequently (verse 20) offered to him, the priest laying his hands upon him and making a confession of the sins of the people. After he has thus become the Lord's, how could he be given up to Satan? The purpose of his being set apart <span class="cmt_word">is to make an atonement with him</span> (not <span class="accented">for him</span>, as some commentators explain it wrongly). As atonement was made by the blood of the sacrificed goat ceremonially covering sin, so it was also made by the live goat symbolically removing sin. But the atonement in both cases has reference to God. How could an atonement be made by an offering to Satan, unless Satan, not God, was the being whose wrath was to be propitiated, and with whom reconciliation was sought? <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Only &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514;, "with this," i.e., with the sacrifices, dress, purifications, and means of expiation mentioned afterwards, could he go into "the holy place," i.e., according to the more precise description in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a>, into the inmost division of the tabernacle, which is called Kodesh hakkadashim, "the holy of holies," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33</a>. He was to bring an ox (bullock) for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering, as a sacrifice for himself and his house (i.e., the priesthood, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-6.htm">Leviticus 16:6</a>), and two he-goats for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering, as a sacrifice for the congregation. For this purpose he was to put on, not the state-costume of the high priest, but a body-coat, drawers, girdle, and head-dress of white cloth (bad: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a>), having first bathed his body, and not merely his hands and feet, as he did for the ordinary service, to appear before Jehovah as entirely cleansed from the defilement of sin (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a>) and arrayed in clothes of holiness. The dress of white cloth was not the plain official dress of the ordinary priests, for the girdle of that dress was coloured (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39-40</a>); and in that case the high priest would not have appeared in the perfect purity of his divinely appointed office as chief of the priesthood, but simply as the priest appointed for this day (v. Hoffmann). Nor did he officiate (as many of the Rabbins, and also C. a Lapide, Grotius, Rosenmller, and Knobel suppose) as a penitent praying humbly for the forgiveness of sin. For where in all the world have clear white clothes been worn either in mourning or as a penitential garment? The emphatic expression, "these are holy garments," is a sufficient proof that the pure white colour of all the clothes, even of the girdle, was intended as a representation of holiness. Although in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4</a>, etc., the official dress not only of Aaron, but of his sons also, that is to say, the priestly costume generally, is described as "holy garments," yet in the present chapter the word kodesh, "holy," is frequently used in an emphatic sense (for example, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-3.htm">Leviticus 16:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-16.htm">Leviticus 16:16</a>, of the most holy place of the dwelling), and by this predicate the dress is characterized as most holy. Moreover, it was in baddim ("linen") that the angel of Jehovah was clothed (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2-3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-11.htm">Ezekiel 9:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-6.htm">Ezekiel 10:6-7</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-6.htm">Daniel 12:6-7</a>), whose whole appearance, as described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>, resembled the appearance of the glory of Jehovah, which Ezekiel saw in the vision of the four cherubim (ch. 1), and was almost exactly like the glory of Jesus Christ, which John saw in the Revelation (<a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13-15</a>). The white material, therefore, of the dress which Aaron wore, when performing the highest act of expiation under the Old Testament, was a symbolical shadowing forth of the holiness and glory of the one perfect Mediator between God and man, who, being the radiation of the glory of God and the image of His nature, effected by Himself the perfect cleansing away of our sin, and who, as the true High Priest, being holy, innocent, unspotted, and separate from sinners, entered once by His own blood into the holy place not made with hands, namely, into heaven itself, to appear before the face of God for us, and obtain everlasting redemption (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>). </body></html>
