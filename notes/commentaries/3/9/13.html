Let us be thankful that we have such a High Priest. The priests had not a day's respite from service allowed. God's spiritual priests have constant work, which the duty of every day requires; they that would give up their account with joy, must redeem time. The glory of God appeared in the sight of the people, and owned what they had done. We are not now to expect such appearances, but God draws nigh to those who draw nigh to him, and the offerings of faith are acceptable to him; though the sacrifices being spiritual, the tokens of the acceptance are spiritual likewise. When Aaron had done all that was to be done about the sacrifices, he lifted up his hands towards the people, and blessed them. Aaron could but crave a blessing, God alone can command it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Aaron did not act according to the ordinary Law <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-5.htm">Leviticus 4:5-7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-16.htm">Leviticus 4:16-18</a>, but as Moses had done in the sin-offering of the consecration ceremony (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-15.htm">Leviticus 8:15</a>; compare also <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-25.htm">Leviticus 4:25</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-30.htm">Leviticus 4:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-34.htm">Leviticus 4:34</a>).
