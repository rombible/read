(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm" title="If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he has sinned, a young bullock without blemish to the LORD for a sin offering.">Leviticus 4:3</a>.) Before they could mediate for the forgiveness of the people, Aaron and his sons had first to bring a sin offering for themselves, in expiation probably for the feeling of pride which they might have fostered at having been so highly distinguished and chosen to be the mediators of the people. This sin offering, however, showed him that, though a high priest, he was beset with the same infirmities, and stood in need of the same atonement, as the people whom he represented. As this is the only instance in which a calf is appointed for a sin offering, and as the offerer who is ordered to bring this exceptional sacrifice is Aaron, Jewish tradition will have it that it was designed to refer to the sin of the golden calf which he made for the people. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/32-4.htm" title="And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a engraving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.">Exodus 32:4-6</a>.) So old and universal is this interpretation, that it is expressed in the ancient Chaldee Version of the Pentateuch. This sense seems to derive support from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-7.htm" title="And Moses said to Aaron, Go to the altar, and offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make an atonement for yourself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.">Leviticus 9:7</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Before the Lord.</span>—That is, before the door of the tent of meeting (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-5.htm" title="And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about on the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-11.htm" title="And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about on the altar.">Leviticus 1:11</a>), on the altar of burnt offering.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-2.htm" title="And he said to Aaron, Take you a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.">Leviticus 9:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">For a sin-offering — </span>For himself and his own sins, which was an evidence of the imperfection of that priesthood, and of the necessity of a better. The Jewish writers suggest, that a calf was appointed to remind him of his sin in making the golden calf. Thereby he had rendered himself for ever unworthy of the honour of the priesthood; on which he had reason to reflect with sorrow and shame, in all the atonements he made.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-21 These many sacrifices, which were all done away by the death of Christ, teach us that our best services need washing in his blood, and that the guilt of our best sacrifices needs to be done away by one more pure and more noble than they. Let us be thankful that we have such a High Priest. The priests had not a day's respite from service allowed. God's spiritual priests have constant work, which the duty of every day requires; they that would give up their account with joy, must redeem time. The glory of God appeared in the sight of the people, and owned what they had done. We are not now to expect such appearances, but God draws nigh to those who draw nigh to him, and the offerings of faith are acceptable to him; though the sacrifices being spiritual, the tokens of the acceptance are spiritual likewise. When Aaron had done all that was to be done about the sacrifices, he lifted up his hands towards the people, and blessed them. Aaron could but crave a blessing, God alone can command it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A young calf - A bull calf, which might have been what we should call a yearling ox.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 9<p>Le 9:1-24. The Priests' Entry into Office.<p>1-7. Moses called &#8230; Take thee a young calf for a sin offering&#8212;The directions in these sacred things were still given by Moses, the circumstances being extraordinary. But he was only the medium of communicating the divine will to the newly made priests. The first of their official acts was the sacrifice of another sin offering to atone for the defects of the inauguration services; and yet that sacrifice did not consist of a bullock&#8212;the sacrifice appointed for some particular transgression, but of a calf, perhaps not without a significant reference to Aaron's sin in the golden calf [Ex 32:22-24]. Then followed a burnt offering, expressive of their voluntary and entire self-devotement to the divine service. The newly consecrated priests having done this on their own account, they were called to offer a sin offering and burnt offering for the people, ending the ceremonial by a peace offering, which was a sacred feast. This injunction, "to make atonement for himself and for the people" (Septuagint, "for thy family"), at the commencement of his sacred functions, furnishes a striking evidence of the divine origin of the Jewish system of worship. In all false or corrupt forms of religion, the studied policy has been to inspire the people with an idea of the sanctity of the priesthood as in point of purity and favor with the Divinity far above the level of other men. But among the Hebrews the priests were required to offer for the expiation of their own sins as well as the humblest of the people. This imperfection of Aaron's priesthood, however, does not extend to the gospel dispensation: for our great High Priest, who has entered for us into "the true tabernacle," "knew no sin" (Heb 10:10, 11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A young calf, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">a calf, the son of a bull or cow</span>; which may seem to be added purposely to intimate that it was not a young calf properly so called, but a <span class="ital">young bullock</span>, for that was the sacrifice enjoined for the high priest’s sin-offering, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm" title="If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he has sinned, a young bullock without blemish to the LORD for a sin offering.">Leviticus 4:3</a></span>.

According to Jewish tradition, expressed in Targ.

Atoning virtue is attributed to this sacrifice in the same sense as to the burnt-offering in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-4.htm">Leviticus 1:4</a>. Whatever was left of the flesh and bread until the following day, that is to say, was not eaten on the day of sacrifice, was to be burned with fire, for the reason explained at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-17.htm">Leviticus 7:17</a>. The exclusion of laymen from participating in this sacrificial meal is to be accounted for in the same way as the prohibition of unleavened bread, which was offered and eaten in the case of the ordinary peace-offerings along with the unleavened sacrificial cakes (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-13.htm">Leviticus 7:13</a>). The meal brought the consecration of the priests to a close, as Aaron and his sons were thereby received into that special, priestly covenant with the Lord, the blessings and privileges of which were to be enjoyed by the consecrated priests alone. At this meal the priests were not allowed to eat leavened bread, any more than the nation generally at the feast of Passover (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8</a>.). </body></html>
