Let us be thankful that we have such a High Priest. The priests had not a day's respite from service allowed. God's spiritual priests have constant work, which the duty of every day requires; they that would give up their account with joy, must redeem time. The glory of God appeared in the sight of the people, and owned what they had done. We are not now to expect such appearances, but God draws nigh to those who draw nigh to him, and the offerings of faith are acceptable to him; though the sacrifices being spiritual, the tokens of the acceptance are spiritual likewise. When Aaron had done all that was to be done about the sacrifices, he lifted up his hands towards the people, and blessed them. Aaron could but crave a blessing, God alone can command it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Aaron did not act according to the ordinary Law <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-5.htm">Leviticus 4:5-7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-16.htm">Leviticus 4:16-18</a>, but as Moses had done in the sin-offering of the consecration ceremony (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-15.htm">Leviticus 8:15</a>; compare also <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-25.htm">Leviticus 4:25</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-30.htm">Leviticus 4:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-34.htm">Leviticus 4:34</a>).

The sin-offering always went first, because it served to remove the estrangement of man from the holy God arising from sin, by means of the expiation of the sinner, and to clear away the hindrances to his approach to God. Then followed the burnt-offering, as an expression of the complete surrender of the person expiated to the Lord; and lastly the peace-offering, on the one hand as the utterance of thanksgiving for mercy received, and prayer for its further continuance, and on the other hand, as a seal of covenant fellowship with the Lord in the sacrificial meal. But when Moses says in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-7.htm">Leviticus 9:7</a>, that Aaron is to make atonement for himself and the nation with his sin-offering and burnt-offering, the atoning virtue which Aaron's sacrifice was to have for the nation also, referred not to sins which the people had committed, but to the guilt which the high priest, as the head of the whole congregation, had brought upon the nation by his sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>). In offering the sacrifices, Aaron was supported by his sons, who handed him the blood to sprinkle, and the sacrificial portions to burn upon the altar. The same course was adopted with Aaron's sin-offering (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-8.htm">Leviticus 9:8-11</a>) as Moses had pursued with the sin-offering at the consecration of the priests (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14-17</a>). The blood was not taken into the sanctuary, but only applied to the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; because the object was not to expiate some particular sin of Aaron's, but to take away the sin which might make his service on behalf of the congregation displeasing to God; and the communion of the congregation with the Lord was carried on at the altar of burnt-offering. The flesh and skin of the animal were burnt outside the camp, as in the case of all the sin-offerings for the priesthood (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-11.htm">Leviticus 4:11-12</a>). </body></html>
