In this manner God afterwards testified His acceptance of the sacrifice of Gideon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/6-20.htm" title="And the angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.

Tradition assures us that the sacred fire which thus issued forth from the immediate presence of God continued to be nourished on the altar with the fuel especially provided by the congregation, and constituted the perpetual fire. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-13.htm" title="The fire shall ever be burning on the altar; it shall never go out.">Leviticus 6:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">They shouted, and fell on their faces.</span>—On seeing these visible tokens of the Divine acceptance of the services, the people expressed their thankfulness in the same manner as they showed it on a similar occasion. Thus we are told—“When all the sons of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the Lord shone upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped and praised the Lord, saying, For he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-3.htm" title="He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.">2Chronicles 27:3</a>).<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-24.htm" title="And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed on the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.">Leviticus 9:24</a></span>. <span class="ital">And there came a fire — </span>In token of God’s approbation of the priesthood now instituted, and the sacrifices offered, and consequently of others of the like nature.

It is said to have lasted till the time of Solomon, when God sent fire anew from heaven to consume the sacrifices offered at the dedication of the temple. And that again is said to have been preserved till the destruction of that first temple. <span class="ital">From before the Lord — </span>Or, <span class="ital">From the presence of the Lord; </span>that is, from the place where God was in a special manner present, either from heaven or from the holy of holies. <span class="ital">They shouted — </span>As wondering at, rejoicing in, and blessing God for, this gracious discovery of himself, and his favour.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This also was a figure of good things to come.

There came a fire out from before the Lord, and consumed the sacrifice. This fire might justly have fastened upon the people, and have consumed them for their sins; but its consuming the sacrifice signified God's acceptance of it, as an atonement for the sinner. This also was a figure of good things to come. The Spirit descended upon the apostles in fire. And the descent of this holy fire into our souls, to kindle in them pious and devout affections toward God, and such a holy zeal as burns up the flesh and the lusts of it, is a certain token of God's gracious acceptance of our persons and performances. Nothing goes to God, but what comes from him. We must have grace, that holy fire, from the God of grace, else we cannot serve him acceptably, Heb 12:28. The people were affected with this discovery of God's glory and grace. They received it with the highest joy; triumphing in the assurance given them that they had God nigh unto them. And with the lowest reverence; humbly adoring the majesty of that God, who vouchsafed thus to manifest himself to them. That is a sinful fear of God, which drives us from him; a gracious fear makes us bow before him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The very ancient Jewish tradition has been widely adopted that the sacred fire of the altar originated in this divine act, and that it was afterward preserved on the altar of the tabernacle until the dedication of the temple, when fire again "came down from heaven." <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>. But according to the sacred narrative the altar-fire had been lighted in a natural way before this occasion. (Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-16.htm">Leviticus 8:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-10.htm">Leviticus 9:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-13.htm">Leviticus 9:13</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-29.htm">Exodus 40:29</a>.) It would therefore seem that the fire which "came out from before the Lord" manifested itself, according to the words of <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>, not in kindling the fuel on the altar, but in the sudden consuming of the victim. For the like testimony to the acceptance of a sacrifice, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-19.htm">Judges 13:19-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>, and probably <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>. The phrase to turn a sacrifice to ashes, became equivalent to accepting it (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/20-3.htm">Psalm 20:3</a>, see the margin). The fire of the altar was maintained in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-13.htm">Leviticus 6:13</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. there came a fire out from &#8230; the Lord&#8212;A flame emanating from that resplendent light that filled the holy place flashed upon the brazen altar and kindled the sacrifices. This miraculous fire&#8212;for the descent of which the people had probably been prepared, and which the priests were enjoined never to let go out (Le 6:13)&#8212;was a sign, not only of the acceptance of the offerings and of the establishment of Aaron's authority, but of God's actual residence in that chosen dwelling-place. The moment the solemn though welcome spectacle was seen, a simultaneous shout of joy and gratitude burst from the assembled congregation, and in the attitude of profoundest reverence they worshipped "a present Deity."   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">There came a fire, </span> in token of God’s acceptation and approbation of the priesthood now instituted, and the sacrifices now offered, and consequently of others of the like nature.

Either from heaven, or from the holy of holies, where was the symbol of the divine Presence, and Jehovah had now took up his residence: <p>and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering, and the fat; according to Aben Ezra, the burnt offering of Aaron, and of the people, and of the daily sacrifice, for so it is written, besides the burnt offering of the morning, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-17.htm">Leviticus 9:17</a> and the fat of the calf and ram of Aaron, and of the goat, ox, and ram of the people, which though they were laid upon the altar at the time of their offering, yet it is thought by some they were not burnt till now: it is a conjecture of Bishop Patrick's, that this burnt offering was the burnt offering of the evening sacrifice, which was consumed by the fire from the Lord; he supposes that the offering of the above sacrifices had taken up the whole day, from the time of the morning sacrifice until the evening; and that all the other sacrifices were burnt with common fire, but this with fire from the Lord; but then, what was the fat that was consumed? however, this was a token of acceptance; in like manner as it descended on the sacrifice of Abel, as is thought, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a> and on the sacrifices offered at the dedication of the temple, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a> and on the burnt sacrifice of Elijah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a> testifying the divine approbation and acceptance of them: for though in the mystery, the fire may design the wrath of God as a consuming fire, which was very distressing to Christ, and brought him to the dust of death; yet, with respect to the persons for whom this sacrifice was offered, it denotes acceptance of it, that it was an offering by fire, and of a sweet smelling savour to God, his law and justice being satisfied, and having honour done them: concerning this fire, and the perpetual burning of it; see Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-12.htm">Leviticus 6:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-13.htm">Leviticus 6:13</a>. The Heathens, in imitation of this, have pretended to have fire come down also from heaven on their altars, as the Brahmans, among the Indians, taken notice of in the above note. And so Solinus (h) speaks of the Vulcanian hill in Sicily, where they that serve in sacred things lay wood of vines on the altar, but put no fire; and if God is present (and so the sacrifice is approved) the branches, though green, will take fire of themselves, and a flame is kindled by the deity sacrificed to, no one setting them on fire. And Servius says (i), that with the ancients fires on altars were not kindled, but they procured a divine fire by their prayers, which kindled on the altars; but these were mere pretences, and juggling tricks, in which they were assisted by Satan to vie with this wonderful appearance of God in the acceptation of the sacrifice of his people: <p>which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces; Aaron blessing them, and the appearance of the glory of God unto them, no doubt, gave them joy and pleasure, as the spiritual blessings by Christ, and the gracious presence of God do to his people, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-1.htm">Psalm 103:1</a> but what filled them with joy unspeakable was the acceptance of their sacrifices, as typical of the sacrifice of Christ, and atonement by it, which made them shout, and the court to ring with it; and yet fell down on their faces with all reverence and humility, under a sense of the divine Majesty being so near unto them, in this sensible token of his presence. <p>(h) Polyhistor. c. 11.

A second blessing follows after Moses and Aaron come out from the temple. God’s approval is signified, for His servant has returned from His presence with gifts of grace for His people.

The blood of this sin-offering, which was presented for the congregation, was not brought into the holy place according to the rule laid down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-16.htm">Leviticus 7:16</a>., but only applied to the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; for the same reason as in the previous case (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-8.htm">Leviticus 9:8</a>.), viz., because the object was not to expiate any particular sin, or the sins of the congregation that had been committed in the course of time and remained unatoned for, but simply to place the sacrificial service of the congregation in its proper relation to the Lord. Aaron was reproved by Moses, however, for having burned the flesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-16.htm">Leviticus 10:16</a>.), but was able to justify it (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-16.htm">Leviticus 10:16-20</a>).

Then followed the meat-offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-17.htm">Leviticus 9:17</a>), of which Aaron burned a handful upon the altar (according to the rule in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-2</a>). He offered this in addition to the morning burnt-offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-39.htm">Exodus 29:39</a>), to which a meat-offering also belonged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>), and with which, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-12.htm">Leviticus 6:12</a>., the special meat-offering of the priests was associated. Last of all (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-18.htm">Leviticus 9:18-21</a>) there followed the peace-offering, which was also carried out according to the general rule.
