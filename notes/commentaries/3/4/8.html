But the Jews were now put into a way of making atonement for sin, more particularly by sacrifice, as a shadow of good things to come; yet the substance is Christ, and that one offering of himself, by which he put away sin. The sins for which the sin-offerings were appointed are supposed to be open acts. They are supposed to be sins of commission, things which ought not to have been done. Omissions are sins, and must come into judgment: yet what had been omitted at one time, might be done at another; but a sin committed was past recall. They are supposed to be sins committed through ignorance. The law begins with the case of the anointed priest. It is evident that God never had any infallible priest in his church upon earth, when even the high priest was liable to fall into sins of ignorance. All pretensions to act without error are sure marks of Antichrist. The beast was to be carried without the camp, and there burned to ashes. This was a sign of the duty of repentance, which is the putting away sin as a detestable thing, which our soul hates. The sin-offering is called sin. What they did to that, we must do to our sins; the body of sin must be destroyed, Ro 6:6. The apostle applies the carrying this sacrifice without the camp to Christ, Heb 13:11-13.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Pour - All the blood that was left after the sprinkling and the smearing should be disposed of in such a manner as to suit the decorum of divine service.

Sin Offering for the Priest.<p>3. If the priest that is anointed do sin&#8212;that is, the high priest, in whom, considering his character as typical mediator, and his exalted office, the people had the deepest interest; and whose transgression of any part of the divine law, therefore, whether done unconsciously or heedlessly, was a very serious offense, both as regarded himself individually, and the influence of his example. He is the person principally meant, though the common order of the priesthood was included.<p>according to the sin of the people&#8212;that is, bring guilt on the people. He was to take a young bullock (the age and sex being expressly mentioned), and having killed it according to the form prescribed for the burnt offerings, he was to take it into the holy place and sprinkle the atoning blood seven times before the veil, and tip with the crimson fluid the horns of the golden altar of incense, on his way to the court of the priests,&#8212;a solemn ceremonial appointed only for very grave and heinous offenses, and which betokened that his sin, though done in ignorance, had vitiated all his services; nor could any official duty he engaged in be beneficial either to himself or the people, unless it were atoned for by blood.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering,....

The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews points to the ideal high priest who is undefiled, separate from sinners (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-26.htm" title="Moreover you shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.">Leviticus 7:26</a>), as distinguished from the high priest under the law, who, by reason of his infirmity, must offer sacrifice for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-27.htm" title="Whatever soul it be that eats any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.">Leviticus 7:27</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-3.htm" title="Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatever uncleanness it be that a man shall be defiled with, and it be hid from him; when he knows of it, then he shall be guilty.">Leviticus 5:3</a>).<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Sin-Offerings. - The ritual prescribed for these differed, with regard to the animals sacrificed, the sprinkling of the blood, and the course adopted with the flesh, according to the position which the person presenting them happened to occupy in the kingdom of God. The classification of persons was as follows: (1) the anointed priest (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2-12</a>); (2) the whole congregation of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-13.htm">Leviticus 5:13</a> -21); (3) the prince (vv. 22-26); (4) the common people (v. 27- <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-13.htm">Leviticus 5:13</a>). In the case of the last, regard was also paid to their circumstances; so that the sin-offerings could be regulated according to the ability of the offerer, especially for the lighter forms of sin (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1-13</a>).<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2</a><p>"If a soul sin in wandering from any (&#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; in a partitive sense) of the commandments of Jehovah, which ought not to be done, and do any one of them" (&#1502;&#1488;&#1495;&#1514; with &#1502;&#1503; partitive, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-13.htm">Leviticus 4:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-22.htm">Leviticus 4:22</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-27.htm">Leviticus 4:27</a>, lit., anything of one). This sentence, which stands at the head of the laws for the sin-offerings, shows that the sin-offerings did not relate to sin or sinfulness in general, but to particular manifestations of sin, to certain distinct actions performed by individuals, or by the whole congregation. The distinguishing characteristic of the sin is expressed by the term &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1490;&#1492; (in error). No sins but those committed &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1490;&#1492; could be expiated by sin-offerings; whilst those committed with a high hand were to be punished by the extermination of the sinner (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-27.htm">Numbers 15:27-31</a>). &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1490;&#1492;, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1490;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1492; to wander or go wrong, signifies mistake, error, oversight. But sinning "in error" is not merely sinning through ignorance (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-13.htm">Leviticus 4:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-22.htm">Leviticus 4:22</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-27.htm">Leviticus 4:27</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-18.htm">Leviticus 5:18</a>), hurry, want of consideration, or carelessness (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-4.htm">Leviticus 5:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15</a>), but also sinning unintentionally (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-11.htm">Numbers 35:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-15.htm">Numbers 35:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-22.htm">Numbers 35:22-23</a>); hence all such sins as spring from the weakness of flesh and blood, as distinguished from sins committed with a high (elevated) hand, or in haughty, defiant rebellion against God and His commandments. </body></html>
