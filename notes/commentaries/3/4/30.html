To be able to plead, when charged with sin, that we did it ignorantly, and through the surprise of temptation, will not bring us off, if we have no interest in that great plea, Christ hath died. The sins of ignorance committed by a common person, needed a sacrifice; the greatest are not above, the meanest are not below Divine justice. None, if offenders, were overlooked. Here rich and poor meet together; they are alike sinners, and welcome to Christ. From all these laws concerning the sin-offerings, we may learn to hate sin, and to watch against it; and to value Christ, the great and true Sin-offering, whose blood cleanses from all sin, which it was not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away. For us to err, with the Bible in our hands, is the effect of pride, sloth, and carelessness. We need to use frequent self-examination, with serious study of the Scriptures, and earnest prayer for the convincing influences of God the Holy Spirit; that we may detect our sins of ignorance, repent, and obtain forgiveness through the blood of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A kid of the goats - A shaggy she-goat. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27-34. if any one of the common people sin through ignorance&#8212;In this case the expiatory offering appointed was a female kid, or a ewe-lamb without blemish; and the ceremonies were exactly the same as those observed in the case of the offending ruler [Le 4:22-26]. In these two latter instances, the blood of the sin offering was applied to the altar of burnt offering&#8212;the place where bloody sacrifices were appointed to be immolated. But the transgression of a high priest, or of the whole congregation, entailing a general taint on the ritual of the tabernacle, and vitiating its services, required a further expiation; and therefore, in these cases, the blood of the sin offering was applied to the altar of incense [Le 4:6, 17].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the priest shall take of the blood,....

It is distinguished in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-16.htm">Numbers 7:16</a>. from the attudim, which were offered as peace-offerings, and frequently occur in connection with oxen, rams, and lambs as burnt-offerings and thank-offerings (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-9.htm">Psalm 50:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-13.htm">Psalm 50:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-15.htm">Psalm 66:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-18.htm">Ezekiel 39:18</a>). According to Knobel, &#1506;&#1494;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, or &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, was an old he-goat, the hair of which grew longer with age, particularly about the neck and back, and &#1506;&#1494;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-28.htm">Leviticus 4:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-16.htm">Leviticus 5:16</a>) an old she-goat; whilst &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491; was the younger he-goat, which leaped upon the does (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-10.htm">Genesis 31:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-12.htm">Genesis 31:12</a>), and served for slaughtering like lambs, sheep, and goats (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-40.htm">Jeremiah 51:40</a>).
