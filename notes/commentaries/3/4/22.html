As the word here translated “ruler” is used for a king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-34.htm" title="However, I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:">1Kings 11:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-24.htm" title="And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken it.">Ezekiel 34:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-2.htm" title="And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.">Ezekiel 46:2</a>), the head of a tribe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/1-4.htm" title="And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of his fathers.">Numbers 1:4-16</a>) or of the division of a tribe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-18.htm" title="And you shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by inheritance.">Numbers 34:18</a>), opinions differ as to the exact position of the personage here meant. Now, in comparing the phrase used with regard to the sin of ignorance in the case of the high priest, the congregation, and any one of the people, it will be seen that in all the three instances it is simply described as a sin “against any commandments of the Lord”(comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:">Leviticus 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-13.htm" title="And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;">Leviticus 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-27.htm" title="And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he does somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty;">Leviticus 4:27</a>), whereas in the case of the ruler, we have the exceptional phrase, “against any of the commandments of the Lord <span class= "ital">his God.” </span>Hence the interpretation obtained during the second Temple that the addition of the phrase <span class= "ital">his God, </span>which shows a peculiar relationship to his God, denotes here one over whom God alone is exalted—the sovereign who is only responsible to <span class= "ital">his God.</span><p><span class= "bld">And is guilty.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">and acknowledges his guilt, </span>as the Authorised Version rightly translates it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-15.htm" title="I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offense, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.">Hosea 5:15</a>. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-5.htm" title="Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.">Zechariah 11:5</a>.) This sense is not only required by the disjunctive particle or, with which the next verse begins, but by the fact that the declaration in the present rendering, “When men sin they are guilty,” is a truism. The sinner is guilty whether he sins advertently or inadvertently. The case here supposed is that the prince had himself come to the knowledge that what he had done was a sin, and had acknowledged it as such.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-22.htm" title="When a ruler has sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty;">Leviticus 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-24.htm" title="And he shall lay his hand on the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering.">Leviticus 4:24</a></span>. <span class="ital">A ruler — </span>Of the people, or a civil magistrate. <span class="ital">Where they kill the burnt-offering — </span>So called by way of eminence, to wit, the daily burnt-offering. <span class="ital">It is a sin-offering — </span>And therefore to be killed where the burnt-offering is killed; whereby it is distinguished from the peace- offerings, which were killed elsewhere.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:22-26 Those who have power to call others to account, are themselves accountable to the Ruler of rulers.

Or "prince", the "nasi", one that is lifted up above others in honour, power, and authority, or that bears the weight of government: the word comes from one which signifies to lift up, or to bear; it may be understood of a governor of a family, or of a tribe, as Aben Ezra observes; and so in the Talmud (k) it is said, it means the prince of a tribe, such as Nachson the son of Amminadab, prince of the tribe of Judah. Maimonides (l) says a king is designed, over whom none has power; and so Gersom on the place, who observes, that David the king is called a prince, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-24.htm">Ezekiel 34:24</a>. <p>and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the Lord his God; the phrase, "his God", is here added, and is not used neither of the anointed priest, nor of the congregation, nor of one of the common people; only of the prince, to show, that though he is above others, God is above him, and he is accountable to him; he is his God, of whom he is, and by whom he rules; wherefore if he breaks any of his commandments, though ignorantly, he must bring a sacrifice for it: <p>concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty; of transgressing negative precepts, which are as binding on him as others. <p>(k) T.

This is the case in &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-29.htm">Genesis 46:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6</a>, &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/10-1.htm">Psalm 10:1</a>, and other words in the critical edition of the Psalter which has been carefully revised by B&#1492;r according to the Masora, and published with an introduction by Delitzsch.

Every transgression of a divine command, whether it took place consciously or unconsciously, brought guilt, and demanded a sin-offering for its expiation; and this was to be presented as soon as the sin was known. The sin-offering, which the elders had to offer in the name of the congregation, was to consist of a young ox, and was to be treated like that of the high priest (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-14.htm">Leviticus 4:14-23</a> compared with <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3-12</a>), inasmuch as "the whole congregation" included the priesthood, or at any rate was on an equality with the priesthood by virtue of its calling in relation to the Lord. &#1495;&#1496;&#1488; with &#1506;&#1500; signifies to incur guilt upon (on the foundation of) sin (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-5.htm">Leviticus 5:5</a>, etc.); it is usually construed with an accusative (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-28.htm">Leviticus 4:28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-6.htm">Leviticus 5:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-10.htm">Leviticus 5:10</a>, etc.), or with &#1489;&#1468;, to sin with a sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-22.htm">Genesis 42:22</a>).
