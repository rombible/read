In case of his own sin offering and in that of the congregation, the high priest himself performed the principal ceremony (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/4-5.htm" title="And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:">Leviticus 4:5-17</a>), whilst at the sin offering of the prince the common priest officiated.

The sin of the ruler, committed through ignorance, must come to his knowledge, either by the check of his own conscience, or by the reproof of his friends; both which even the best and greatest, not only should submit to, but be thankful for. That which I see not, teach thou me, and, Show me wherein I have erred, are prayers we should put up to God every day; that if, through ignorance, we fall into sin, we may not through ignorance abide in it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-11.htm">Leviticus 1:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22-26.

This is the case in &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-29.htm">Genesis 46:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6</a>, &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/10-1.htm">Psalm 10:1</a>, and other words in the critical edition of the Psalter which has been carefully revised by B&#1492;r according to the Masora, and published with an introduction by Delitzsch.

Every transgression of a divine command, whether it took place consciously or unconsciously, brought guilt, and demanded a sin-offering for its expiation; and this was to be presented as soon as the sin was known. The sin-offering, which the elders had to offer in the name of the congregation, was to consist of a young ox, and was to be treated like that of the high priest (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-14.htm">Leviticus 4:14-23</a> compared with <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3-12</a>), inasmuch as "the whole congregation" included the priesthood, or at any rate was on an equality with the priesthood by virtue of its calling in relation to the Lord. &#1495;&#1496;&#1488; with &#1506;&#1500; signifies to incur guilt upon (on the foundation of) sin (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-5.htm">Leviticus 5:5</a>, etc.); it is usually construed with an accusative (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-28.htm">Leviticus 4:28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-6.htm">Leviticus 5:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-10.htm">Leviticus 5:10</a>, etc.), or with &#1489;&#1468;, to sin with a sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-22.htm">Genesis 42:22</a>).
