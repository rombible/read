With the finger thus dipped into it, he is to put some of the blood on each of the four horns of the golden altar on which the incense was offered.<p>This process, too, was peculiar to the sacrifice of the sin offering. The altar was placed in the holy place before the vail which separated off the holy of holies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/30-1.htm" title="And you shall make an altar to burn incense on: of shittim wood shall you make it.">Exodus 30:1-6</a>). According to the practice which obtained in the time of Christ, the priest began by putting the blood first on the north-east horn, then on the north-west, then on the south-west, and, lastly, on the south-east horn. He dipped his finger in the blood of the bowl at the sprinkling of each horn, and wiped his finger on the edge of the bowl between the separate sprinklings, as the blood which remained on his finger from one horn was not deemed fit to be put on the other.<p><span class= "bld">And shall pour all the blood.</span>—That is, all the remaining blood. The bulk of the blood which remained, after expending the small quantity on the horns of the incense altar inside the sanctuary, the priest poured out at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering, which stood outside the holy place. At the time of the second Temple, there were at the southwest horn of this altar two holes, like two nostrils, through which the blood ran into a drain conveying it into the brook of Kedron.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-12 Burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, and peace-offerings, had been offered before the giving of the law upon mount Sinai; and in these the patriarchs had respect to sin, to make atonement for it. But the Jews were now put into a way of making atonement for sin, more particularly by sacrifice, as a shadow of good things to come; yet the substance is Christ, and that one offering of himself, by which he put away sin. The sins for which the sin-offerings were appointed are supposed to be open acts. They are supposed to be sins of commission, things which ought not to have been done. Omissions are sins, and must come into judgment: yet what had been omitted at one time, might be done at another; but a sin committed was past recall. They are supposed to be sins committed through ignorance. The law begins with the case of the anointed priest. It is evident that God never had any infallible priest in his church upon earth, when even the high priest was liable to fall into sins of ignorance. All pretensions to act without error are sure marks of Antichrist. The beast was to be carried without the camp, and there burned to ashes. This was a sign of the duty of repentance, which is the putting away sin as a detestable thing, which our soul hates. The sin-offering is called sin. What they did to that, we must do to our sins; the body of sin must be destroyed, Ro 6:6. The apostle applies the carrying this sacrifice without the camp to Christ, Heb 13:11-13.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Pour - All the blood that was left after the sprinkling and the smearing should be disposed of in such a manner as to suit the decorum of divine service.

Sin Offering for the Priest.<p>3. If the priest that is anointed do sin&#8212;that is, the high priest, in whom, considering his character as typical mediator, and his exalted office, the people had the deepest interest; and whose transgression of any part of the divine law, therefore, whether done unconsciously or heedlessly, was a very serious offense, both as regarded himself individually, and the influence of his example. He is the person principally meant, though the common order of the priesthood was included.<p>according to the sin of the people&#8212;that is, bring guilt on the people. He was to take a young bullock (the age and sex being expressly mentioned), and having killed it according to the form prescribed for the burnt offerings, he was to take it into the holy place and sprinkle the atoning blood seven times before the veil, and tip with the crimson fluid the horns of the golden altar of incense, on his way to the court of the priests,&#8212;a solemn ceremonial appointed only for very grave and heinous offenses, and which betokened that his sin, though done in ignorance, had vitiated all his services; nor could any official duty he engaged in be beneficial either to himself or the people, unless it were atoned for by blood.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">The altar of sweet incense which is in the tabernacle</span>; the altar of burnt-offerings was without the tabernacle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All the blood; </span> so also below, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-18.htm" title="And he shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 4:18</a>,30,34</span>, to wit, all the rest, as it is expressed <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-9.htm" title="And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering.">Leviticus 5:9</a></span>, for part was disposed elsewhere. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the priest shall put some of the blood,.... With his finger, which he dipped into it: <p>upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the Lord, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; this was the golden altar on which incense was offered: it was placed before the vail, on the outside of it, in the holy place, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1</a> and the priest, when he put the blood on the horns of it, began at the northeast horn, so to the northwest, then to the southwest, and last to the southeast (w); and the priest dipped his finger at every horn, and when he had finished at one horn, he wiped his finger at the edge of the basin, and after that dipped a second time; for what remained of the blood on his finger was not fit to put upon another horn (x). This rite shows, that the intercession of Christ, signified by the altar of sweet incense, proceeds upon the foot of his blood and sacrifice, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3</a> <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>, <p>and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; this altar stood without the holy place, and the altar of incense within; and after the priest had sprinkled of the blood of the bullock, upon the horns of the altar of incense, what remained he poured at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering; for though it is said "all" the blood, it can mean no more than what was left; wherefore the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "all the remaining blood": and Jarchi's explanatory note is, the rest of the blood. The place where this was poured, according to Maimonides (y), was the west bottom of the altar; and Gersom on the place observes the same. This denotes the efficacy of Christ's blood to make atonement for sin, and the reverent esteem it ought to be had in, being precious blood. <p>(w) Misn. Yoma, c. 5. sect. 5. Maimon. ib.

But in ch. 4 and 5 sacrifices are appointed for different offences, which receive their names for the first time from the objects to which they apply, i.e., from the sin, or the trespass, or debt to be expiated by them: viz., &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; sin, i.e., sin-offering (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-8.htm">Leviticus 4:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-14.htm">Leviticus 4:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-19.htm">Leviticus 4:19</a>, etc.), and &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; debt, i.e., debt-offering (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15-16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-19.htm">Leviticus 5:19</a>); - a clear proof that the sin and debt-offerings were introduced at the same time as the Mosaic law.
