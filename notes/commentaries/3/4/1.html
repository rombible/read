But the Jews were now put into a way of making atonement for sin, more particularly by sacrifice, as a shadow of good things to come; yet the substance is Christ, and that one offering of himself, by which he put away sin. The sins for which the sin-offerings were appointed are supposed to be open acts. They are supposed to be sins of commission, things which ought not to have been done. Omissions are sins, and must come into judgment: yet what had been omitted at one time, might be done at another; but a sin committed was past recall. They are supposed to be sins committed through ignorance. The law begins with the case of the anointed priest. It is evident that God never had any infallible priest in his church upon earth, when even the high priest was liable to fall into sins of ignorance. All pretensions to act without error are sure marks of Antichrist. The beast was to be carried without the camp, and there burned to ashes. This was a sign of the duty of repentance, which is the putting away sin as a detestable thing, which our soul hates. The sin-offering is called sin. What they did to that, we must do to our sins; the body of sin must be destroyed, Ro 6:6. The apostle applies the carrying this sacrifice without the camp to Christ, Heb 13:11-13.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the Lord spake ...

The Sin-Offering is for sins committed <span class="ital">unwittingly</span> (<span class="ital">through ignorance</span> A.V.); for sins committed presumptuously (Heb. <span class="ital">with an high hand</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-30.htm" title="But the soul that does ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproaches the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.">Numbers 15:30</a>) the punishment is ‘that soul shall be cut off from among his people.’ The same distinction is drawn in Psalms 19 where ‘hidden (‘secret’ A.V.) <span class="ital">faults</span>’ (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-12.htm" title="Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.">Leviticus 4:12</a></span>) are contrasted with ‘presumptuous <span class="ital">sins</span>’ (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-13.htm" title="And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;">Leviticus 4:13</a></span>).

At the time of the Mosaic legislation, burnt offerings and meat offerings were already in existence, and had existed from the time of the Fall. A beginning, therefore, is made with them, and the regulations of the peace offerings naturally follow, because these sacrifices succeed in order to the burnt and meat offerings, and because sacrifices in some respects of the same nature as peace offerings had previously existed under a different name (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-25.htm">Exodus 10:25</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>, and see above notes on chapter 3). The sin and trespass offerings, therefore, are left to the last, though, owing to their meaning, they were always offered first of all, when sacrifices of all three kinds were made together. They are the means of ceremonially propitiating God when alienated from his people, or from any individual member of it, by sin, which they legally atone for. The need of expiation is implied and suggested by the offering of the blood, both in the burnt sacrifice and the peace offering (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a>). But this was not sufficient; there must be a special sacrifice to teach this great truth as its primary lesson. The sin offering typifies the sacrifice of our Lord JESUS CHRIST upon the cross, as the great Sin Offering for mankind, whereby the wrath of God was propitiated, and an expiation for the sins of man was wrought, bringing about reconciliation between God and man. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The same rules apply to the peace-offerings of sheep and goats, except that, in addition to the fat portions, which were to be burned upon the altar in the case of the oxen (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-3.htm">Leviticus 3:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-4.htm">Leviticus 3:4</a>) and goats (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-14.htm">Leviticus 3:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-15.htm">Leviticus 3:15</a>), the fat tail of the sheep was to be consumed as well. &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;: "the fat tail whole" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-9.htm">Leviticus 3:9</a>), cauda ovilla vel arietina eaque crassa et adiposa; the same in Arabic (Ges. thes. p. 102). The fat tails which the sheep have in Northern Africa and Egypt, also in Arabia, especially Southern Arabia, and Syria, often weigh 15 lbs. or more, and small carriages on wheels are sometimes placed under them to bear their weight (Sonnini, R. ii. p. 358; Bochart, Hieroz. i. pp. 556ff.). It consists of something between marrow and fat. Ordinary sheep are also found in Arabia and Syria; but in modern Palestine all the sheep are "of the broad-tailed species." The broad part of the tail is an excresence of fat, from which the true tail hangs down (Robinson, Pal. ii. 166). "Near the rump-bone shall he (the offerer) take it (the fat tail) away," i.e., separate it from the body. &#1506;&#1510;&#1501;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., is, according to Saad., os caudae s. coccygis, i.e., the rump or tail-bone, which passes over into the vertebrae of the tail (cf. Bochart, i. pp. 560-1). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-11.htm">Leviticus 3:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a> the fat portions which were burned are called "food of the firing for Jehovah," or "food of the firing for a sweet savour," i.e., food which served as a firing for Jehovah, or reached Jehovah by being burned; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/28-24.htm">Numbers 28:24</a>, "food of the firing of a sweet savour for Jehovah." Hence not only are the daily burnt-offerings and the burnt and sin-offerings of the different feasts called "food of Jehovah" ("My bread," <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-2.htm">Numbers 28:2</a>); but the sacrifices generally are described as "the food of God" ("the bread of their God," <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-6.htm">Leviticus 21:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-8.htm">Leviticus 21:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-17.htm">Leviticus 21:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-21.htm">Leviticus 21:21-22</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-25.htm">Leviticus 22:25</a>), as food, that is, which Israel produced and caused to ascend to its God in fire as a sweet smelling savour. - Nothing is determined here with regard to the appropriation of the flesh of the peace-offerings, as their destination for a sacrificial meal was already known from traditional custom. The more minute directions for the meal itself are given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11-36</a>, where the meaning of these sacrifices is more fully explained. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>) the general rule is added, "all fat belongs to Jehovah," and the law, "eat neither fat nor blood," is enforced as "an eternal statute" for the generations of Israel (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-24.htm">Exodus 12:24</a>) in all their dwelling-places (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-23.htm">Exodus 10:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-20.htm">Exodus 12:20</a>). </body></html>
