Any priest who ate the most holy things outside the wall of the courts, or the less holy things outside of the walls of Jerusalem, received forty stripes save one.<p><span class= "bld">Every one that toucheth them shall be holy.</span>—According to this rendering, which exhibits one of the views that obtained during the second Temple, the meaning is that any one who touches the sacrifices of the first order of holiness must not only be a descendant of Aaron and a male, but must have sanctified himself by undergoing the necessary ablutions. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/22-6.htm" title="The soul which has touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.">Leviticus 22:6-7</a>.) There is, however, another view of the passage which is of equal, if not of anterior, date. That is, <span class= "ital">whoso </span>or <span class= "ital">whatsoever toucheth them shall become holy. </span>Any layman or any ordinary utensil, &c., becomes sacred by touching one of the higher order of sanctity.

And the priests answered and said, No.">Haggai 2:12</a>, the garment in which ‘holy flesh’ is carried, does not communicate holiness to the food which it may happen to touch.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Holiness is here regarded as a contagious quality; contact with holy things must be avoided, just as contact with things that are considered unclean is forbidden. This similarity in the treatment of things which from the levitical standpoint are so widely separated as the holy and the unclean is a survival of primitive modes of expression, due to imperfect conception of the gods, and of their relations to men.

For this purpose the priest was to burn wood upon it (the altar-fire), and lay the burnt-offering in order upon it, and cause the fat portions of the peace-offerings to ascend in smoke, - that is to say, whenever peace-offerings were brought, for they were not prescribed for every day. </body></html>
