The Law of the Burnt-Offering commences the series, and special reference is made to the daily burnt-offering (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>).<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-8.htm">Leviticus 6:8</a><p>"It, the burnt-offering, shall (burn) upon the hearth upon the altar the whole night till the morning, and the fire of the altar be kept burning with it." The verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; is wanting in the first clause, and only introduced in the second; but it belongs to the first clause as well. The pronoun &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; at the opening of the sentence cannot stand for the verb to be in the imperative. The passages, which Knobel adduces in support of this, are of a totally different kind. The instructions apply primarily to the burnt-offering, which was offered every evening, and furnished the basis for all the burnt-offerings (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-39</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/33-3.htm">Numbers 33:3-4</a>).</body></html>
