The legislator, therefore, now passes on to other blemishes, which, though not voluntarily contracted, likewise disqualify the priests for performing sacerdotal duties in the sanctuary.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-24 Laws concerning the priests. - As these priests were types of Christ, so all ministers must be followers of him, that their example may teach others to imitate the Saviour. Without blemish, and separate from sinners, He executed his priestly office on earth. What manner of persons then should his ministers be! But all are, if Christians, spiritual priests; the minister especially is called to set a good example, that the people may follow it. Our bodily infirmities, blessed be God, cannot now shut us out from his service, from these privileges, or from his heavenly glory. Many a healthful, beautiful soul is lodged in a feeble, deformed body. And those who may not be suited for the work of the ministry, may serve God with comfort in other duties in his church.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He was not treated as an outcast, but enjoyed his privileges as a son of Aaron, except in regard to active duties.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-24. Whosoever he be &#8230; hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God&#8212;As visible things exert a strong influence on the minds of men, any physical infirmity or malformation of body in the ministers of religion, which disturbs the associations or excites ridicule, tends to detract from the weight and authority of the sacred office. Priests laboring under any personal defect were not allowed to officiate in the public service; they might be employed in some inferior duties about the sanctuary but could not perform any sacred office. In all these regulations for preserving the unsullied purity of the sacred character and office, there was a typical reference to the priesthood of Christ (Heb 7:26).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord spake unto Moses,....

He, whose head had been anointed with oil, and who had been sanctified to put on the holy clothes (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-7.htm">Leviticus 8:7-12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-37.htm">Leviticus 7:37</a>), was not to go with his hair flying loose when a death had taken place, nor to rend his clothes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>), nor to go in to any dead body (&#1502;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; souls of a departed one, i.e., dead persons); he was not to defile himself (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-2.htm">Leviticus 21:2</a>) on account of his father and mother (i.e., when they were dead), nor to go out of the sanctuary funeris nempe causa (Ros.), to give way to his grief or attend the funeral. We are not to understand by this, however, that the sanctuary was to be his constant abode, as Bhr and Baumgarten maintain (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-7.htm">Leviticus 10:7</a>). "Neither shall he profane the sanctuary of his God," sc., by any defilement of his person which he could and ought to avoid; "for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-7.htm">Leviticus 10:7</a>), and defilement was incompatible with this. &#1504;&#1494;&#1512; does not mean the diadem of the high priest here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-6.htm">Exodus 29:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/39-30.htm">Exodus 39:30</a>, but consecration (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-7.htm">Numbers 6:7</a>). </body></html>
