The first of these enactments is also enjoined by St. Paul on Christian bishops (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm" title="A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;">1Timothy 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-16.htm" title="They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate.">Titus 1:16</a>); whilst the fourth is actually expressed in the Greek version (LXX.), which has at the end of the verse, “of his own race.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-13.htm" title="And he shall take a wife in her virginity.">Leviticus 21:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">In her virginity — </span>Or, a virgin, partly because, as he was a type of Christ, so his wife was a type of the church, which is compared to a virgin; and partly for greater caution and assurance that his wife was not a defiled or deflowered person.

Without blemish, and separate from sinners, He executed his priestly office on earth. What manner of persons then should his ministers be! But all are, if Christians, spiritual priests; the minister especially is called to set a good example, that the people may follow it. Our bodily infirmities, blessed be God, cannot now shut us out from his service, from these privileges, or from his heavenly glory. Many a healthful, beautiful soul is lodged in a feeble, deformed body. And those who may not be suited for the work of the ministry, may serve God with comfort in other duties in his church.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Go out of the sanctuary - i. e. not for the purpose to which reference is here made.

Moreover, the high dignity of his office demanded a corresponding superiority in personal holiness, and stringent rules were prescribed for the purpose of upholding the suitable dignity of his station and family. The same rules are extended to the families of Christian ministers (1Ti 3:2; Tit 1:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or, a virgin, partly for the decency of the type, because as he was a type of Christ, so his wife was a type of the church, which is compared to a virgin, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:2</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-4.htm" title="These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins.

One, and not two, or more, as Ben Gersom observes; and so Maimonides says (q), an high priest might never take two women together; for it is said, "a wife", or "woman", one, and not two; and so it is explained in the Talmud (r); for though polygamy was practised by the Israelites, and even by the common priests, yet these writers suppose it was by no means allowed to an high priest: among the Egyptians, though they took as many wives as they pleased, their priests, married but one (s); and so a minister of the New Testament is to be the husband of one wife, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>; and this wife the high priest was to take was to be a "virgin", one that not only had never known a man, but that was never betrothed to any; yea, according to the Talmudists (t), who was not quite ripe for marriage, or the time of her puberty not fully completed, which was the age of twelve years; within, or somewhat before that time, the high priest was to marry her, that it might be out of all doubt that she was a pure virgin; since it is said, "in her virginity", within the time of her puberty, before it was quite up; this, by many, is thought to be an emblem of Christ and his church; as he was typified by the high priest, so the church by the virgin he married, which is espoused to Christ as a chaste virgin, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>. <p>(q) Hilchot Issure Biah, c. 17. sect. 13.

They were not to marry a whore (i.e., a public prostitute), or a fallen woman, or a woman put away (divorced) from her husband, that is to say, any person of notoriously immoral life, for this would be irreconcilable with the holiness of the priesthood, but (as may be seen from this in comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-14.htm">Leviticus 21:14</a>) only a virgin or widow of irreproachable character. She need not be an Israelite, but might be the daughter of a stranger living among the Israelites; only she must not be an idolater or a Canaanite, for the Israelites were all forbidden to marry such a woman (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>).</body></html>
