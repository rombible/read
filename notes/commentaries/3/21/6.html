Without blemish, and separate from sinners, He executed his priestly office on earth. What manner of persons then should his ministers be! But all are, if Christians, spiritual priests; the minister especially is called to set a good example, that the people may follow it. Our bodily infirmities, blessed be God, cannot now shut us out from his service, from these privileges, or from his heavenly glory. Many a healthful, beautiful soul is lodged in a feeble, deformed body.

But the priests were to be laid under a special injunction, not only that they might exhibit examples of piety in the moderation of their grief, but also by the restraint of their passions, be the better qualified to administer the consolations of religion to others, and show, by their faith in a blessed resurrection, the reasons for sorrowing not as those who have no hope.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Holy unto their God; </span> devoted to God’s service, and always prepared and fit for it; and therefore shall keep themselves as far as they can from all defilement, which makes them unmeet for their Master’s use. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Not profane the name of their God, </span> which they especially bear; they shall not disparage the service of God by making it give place to such slight occasions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The bread of their God, </span> i.e. the shew-bread; or rather, all the other offerings besides burntofferings; which are called bread, either because bread is commonly put for all food, as below, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-17.htm" title="Speak to Aaron, saying, Whoever he be of your seed in their generations that has any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.">Leviticus 21:17</a>,21</span>; or because God is satisfied and refreshed with these offerings, as a man is with his bread; or rather, because they, or part of them, are the bread or food of the priests, and are here called <span class="ital">the bread of their God</span>, either objectively, because they were offered to God, or efficiently, because they were given by God to the priests.
