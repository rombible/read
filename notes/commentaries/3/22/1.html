Let us recollect with gratitude that our great High Priest cannot be hindered by any thing from the discharge of his office. Let us also remember, that the Lord requires us to reverence his name, his truths, his ordinances, and commandments. Let us beware of hypocrisy, and examine ourselves concerning our sinful defilements, seeking to be purified from them in the blood of Christ, and by his sanctifying Spirit. Whoever attempts to expiate his own sin, or draws near in the pride of self-righteousness, puts as great an affront on Christ, as he who comes to the Lord's table from the gratification of sinful lusts. Nor can the minister who loves the souls of the people, suffer them to continue in this dangerous delusion. He must call upon them, not only to repent of their sins, and forsake them; but to put their whole trust in the atonement of Christ, by faith in his name, for pardon and acceptance with God; thus only will the Lord make them holy, as his own people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sanctuaries - The places especially holy, including the most holy place, the holy place, and the altar.<p>This law is of course to be regarded as one development of the great principle that all which is devoted to the service of God should be as perfect as possible of its kind. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 22<p>Le 22:1-9.

At these times they are here instructed that they must abstain from their priestly functions, and not even eat of the priests' portions until they have been cleansed. The command to <span class="cmt_word">Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel</span>, in verse 2, must be read in the light of the following verses, and understood to mean that they are <span class="accented">to separate themselves from the holy things</span> when they are unclean. The different forms of uncleanness which are to produce this effect are enumerated in verses 4-6. In most cases the uncleanness would not last beyond sunset on the day on which it was incurred, but occasionally, as when a priest became a leper, a permanent disqualification would be caused, or one that lasted for a considerable length of time. The law with respect to abstaining from holy things while unclean is to be of permanent obligation. Whoever disobeys it is to be <span class="cmt_word">cut off from God's presence</span>; that is, he is to be excluded from the sanctuary by being deprived of his priestly office. Verse 8 repeats the prohibition of eating flesh containing blood. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Whoever had a fracture in his foot or hand. </body></html>
