Jewish canonists, however, regard this verse as regulating the sacrifices offered by Gentiles, and maintain that the same law about defective animals is here laid down in their case. But the manifest contrast between the expression, when the deed is done “in your land,” at the end of the preceding verse, and the words “from the hand of a foreigner,” at the beginning of this verse; and more especially the declaration in the clause before us, “they shall not be acceptable for you,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Israelites, show beyond doubt that the Israelites themselves are here spoken of as the offerers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-25.htm" title="Neither from a stranger's hand shall you offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.">Leviticus 22:25</a></span>. <span class="ital">Neither from a stranger’s hand — </span>From proselytes: even from those, such should not be accepted, much less from the Israelites. <span class="ital">The bread of your God — </span>That is, the sacrifices.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:1-33 Laws concerning the priests and sacrifices. - In this chapter we have divers laws concerning the priests and sacrifices, all for preserving the honour of the sanctuary. Let us recollect with gratitude that our great High Priest cannot be hindered by any thing from the discharge of his office. Let us also remember, that the Lord requires us to reverence his name, his truths, his ordinances, and commandments. Let us beware of hypocrisy, and examine ourselves concerning our sinful defilements, seeking to be purified from them in the blood of Christ, and by his sanctifying Spirit. Whoever attempts to expiate his own sin, or draws near in the pride of self-righteousness, puts as great an affront on Christ, as he who comes to the Lord's table from the gratification of sinful lusts. Nor can the minister who loves the souls of the people, suffer them to continue in this dangerous delusion. He must call upon them, not only to repent of their sins, and forsake them; but to put their whole trust in the atonement of Christ, by faith in his name, for pardon and acceptance with God; thus only will the Lord make them holy, as his own people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A stranger's hand - The word here rendered "stranger", is not the same as that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-18.htm">Leviticus 22:18</a> : it means literally, "the son of the unknown", and probably refers to one dwelling in another land who desired to show respect to the God of Israel.

That is, from a Gentile, a proselyte of the gate, who had renounced idolatry, and was willing to offer sacrifice to the true God; but what had such defects and blemishes in them as before described the priest might not take of his hands, and offer on the altar of God; and this is the rather observed, because on the one hand the Gentile might think such sacrifices would be acceptable, since he might have been used to offer such to idols; and on the other hand, the priest might think such would do well enough for Gentiles, though not for Israelites: <p>because their corruption is in them; or they are corrupt through being bruised, crushed, broken, or cut: <p>and blemishes be in them; which seems to be added to explain the former, and may have respect to all the blemishes before named, and whatsoever is included in them; for though there are but here mentioned, the Jews reckon no less than fifty (c): <p>they shall not be accepted for you; to make atonement for you; Jarchi says, or "from you", the priests; they shall not be accepted of the Lord from their hands, and so be of no avail to the offerers, nor to those for whom they are offered. <p>(c) Maimon.
