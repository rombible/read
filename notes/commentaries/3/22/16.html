Let us recollect with gratitude that our great High Priest cannot be hindered by any thing from the discharge of his office. Let us also remember, that the Lord requires us to reverence his name, his truths, his ordinances, and commandments. Let us beware of hypocrisy, and examine ourselves concerning our sinful defilements, seeking to be purified from them in the blood of Christ, and by his sanctifying Spirit. Whoever attempts to expiate his own sin, or draws near in the pride of self-righteousness, puts as great an affront on Christ, as he who comes to the Lord's table from the gratification of sinful lusts. Nor can the minister who loves the souls of the people, suffer them to continue in this dangerous delusion. He must call upon them, not only to repent of their sins, and forsake them; but to put their whole trust in the atonement of Christ, by faith in his name, for pardon and acceptance with God; thus only will the Lord make them holy, as his own people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses are rather difficult.

The subject of the preceding context being occupied about the priests, it is supposed by some that this relates to them also; and the meaning then is that the whole people would incur guilt through the fault of the priests, if they should defile the sacred offerings, which they would have done had they presented them while under any defilement [Calvin]. According to others, "the children of Israel" is the nominative in the sentence; which thus signifies, the children of Israel shall not profane or defile their offerings, by touching them or reserving any part of them, lest they incur the guilt of eating what is divinely appointed to the priests alone [Calmet].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. <span class="ital">They</span>, i.e. the priests shall not (the negative particle being understood out of the foregoing clause, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-5.htm" title="Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.">Psalm 1:5</a> 9:18</span> <span class="ital">suffer them</span>, i.e. the people, to bear the iniquity of trespass, i.e. the punishment of their sin, which they might expect from God, and for the prevention whereof the priest was to see restitution made, &c.

The punishment of sin: either the strangers: <p>when they eat their holy things; the holy things belonging to the priests, which they permitting them to do, suffer them to be liable to the punishment incurred thereby, or else the priests themselves; so the Septuagint version renders the word "themselves"; and in like manner Jarchi interprets it; and then the sense may be, according to the Targums of Jonathan and Onkelos, that the priests shall bear the punishment of their sins,"when they shall eat the holy things in uncleanness,''which is what is forbidden them in the former part of the chapter; but this seems to be too remote; rather the former sense is best: <p>for I the Lord do sanctify them; both the priests, to whom the holy things belong, and the holy things for their use, and the use of their families, and them only. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.</span><p>(h) For if they did not offer sacrifice for their error, the people by their example might commit the same offence.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/leviticus/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt</span>] The expression is unique.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>No stranger was to eat a sanctified thing. &#1494;&#1512; is in general the non-priest, then any person who was not fully incorporated into a priestly family, e.g., a visitor or day-labourer (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-49.htm">Exodus 12:49</a>), who were neither of them members of his family.</body></html>
