Let us recollect with gratitude that our great High Priest cannot be hindered by any thing from the discharge of his office. Let us also remember, that the Lord requires us to reverence his name, his truths, his ordinances, and commandments. Let us beware of hypocrisy, and examine ourselves concerning our sinful defilements, seeking to be purified from them in the blood of Christ, and by his sanctifying Spirit. Whoever attempts to expiate his own sin, or draws near in the pride of self-righteousness, puts as great an affront on Christ, as he who comes to the Lord's table from the gratification of sinful lusts. Nor can the minister who loves the souls of the people, suffer them to continue in this dangerous delusion. He must call upon them, not only to repent of their sins, and forsake them; but to put their whole trust in the atonement of Christ, by faith in his name, for pardon and acceptance with God; thus only will the Lord make them holy, as his own people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye shall offer at your own will a male - Rather, That it may be accepted (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-29.htm">Leviticus 22:29</a>) for you it shall be a male.

It is the same phrase as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-20.htm">Leviticus 22:20-21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-27.htm">Leviticus 22:27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. Ye shall offer at your own will&#8212;rather, to your being accepted.<p>a male without blemish&#8212;This law (Le 1:3) is founded on a sense of natural propriety, which required the greatest care to be taken in the selection of animals for sacrifice. The reason for this extreme caution is found in the fact that sacrifices are either an expression of praise to God for His goodness, or else they are the designed means of conciliating or retaining His favor. No victim that was not perfect in its kind could be deemed a fitting instrument for such purposes if we assume that the significance of sacrifices is derived entirely from their relation to Jehovah. Sacrifices may be likened to gifts made to a king by his subjects, and hence the reasonableness of God's strong remonstrance with the worldly-minded Jews (Mal 1:8). If the tabernacle, and subsequently the temple, were considered the palace of the great King, then the sacrifices would answer to presents as offered to a monarch on various occasions by his subjects; and in this light they would be the appropriate expressions of their feelings towards their sovereign. When a subject wished to do honor to his sovereign, to acknowledge allegiance, to appease his anger, to supplicate forgiveness, or to intercede for another, he brought a present; and all the ideas involved in sacrifices correspond to these sentiments&#8212;those of gratitude, of worship, of prayer, of confession and atonement [Bib.

This, as Ben Gersom observes, is distinguished from a burnt offering; for though it was to be perfect, and without blemish, yet not obliged to be a male as that, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-1.htm">Leviticus 3:1</a>. This was either by way of thanksgiving for mercies received, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12</a>, or <p>to accomplish his vow; made in any distress, that if God would deliver him, then he would offer such a sacrifice: <p>or a freewill offering; either on account of favours received, or in order to obtain them: which sacrifice, whether <p>in beeves or sheep; whether in bullocks or sheep, under which are comprehended goats, both being of the flock, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-19.htm">Leviticus 22:19</a>, <p>it shall be perfect to be accepted; perfect in all its parts, not only in those that are without and obvious to view, but in those that are within: wherefore the Jewish writers say (w), if it had but one kidney, or the spleen was consumed, it was unfit for the altar; wherefore, in order to be an acceptable sacrifice to God, it was to be complete in all respects: <p>there shall be no blemish therein; which is repeated for the confirmation of it, and that it might be observed. Such sacrifices were typical of Christ, the immaculate Lamb of God, who offered himself without spot to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>; and shows that no sacrifice of man's can be so acceptable to God as to atone for him, since none of theirs are perfect, and without blemish. <p>(w) Maimon.

Understood in this way, both verses furnish a fitting conclusion to the section <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10-14</a>. On the other hand, according to the traditional interpretation of these verses, the priesthood is regarded as the subject of the first verb, and a negative supplied before the second. Both of these are arbitrary and quite indefensible, because <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10-14</a> do not refer to the priests but to laymen, and in the latter case we should expect &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1512;&#1500;&#1488; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-9.htm">Leviticus 22:9</a>) instead of the unusual &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;. </body></html>
