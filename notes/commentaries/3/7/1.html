The flesh of these sin-offerings was to be eaten by the priest who officiated at a holy place, in the fore-court (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-16.htm">Leviticus 6:16</a>). Whoever touched it became holy (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-18.htm">Leviticus 6:18</a>); and if any one sprinkled any of the blood upon his clothes, whatever the blood was sprinkled upon was to be washed in a holy place, in order that the most holy blood might not be carried out of the sanctuary into common life along with the sprinkled clothes, and thereby be profaned. The words "thou shalt wash" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-20.htm">Leviticus 6:20</a> are addressed to the priest. </body></html>
