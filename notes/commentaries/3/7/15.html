This limitation of time was designed both to encourage liberality to the poor, and to impress upon those who partook of it that it was a sacrificial and sacred feast, so as to prevent its being turned into unseemly conviviality.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-15.htm" title="And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.">Leviticus 7:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">The flesh shall be eaten the same day — </span>This was partly that none of it might be exposed to corruption, (for by the third day it might easily, in those hot countries, putrefy,) and partly that the offerer might not be sordidly saving of this sacred banquet, but be taught to show his piety to God by his love to his fellow-creatures, forthwith inviting his friends to partake of it with him; and in case he and they could not eat it up, by distributing the remains among the poor. This law might also be intended to prevent their spending many days in feasting under the pretence of religion. It may be observed further here, that the longest time allowed for eating the flesh of any of the sacrifices enjoined by Moses, was the day after that on which they were killed; the eating of it on the third day is declared to be an abomination.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:11-27 As to the peace-offerings, in the expression of their sense of mercy, God left them more at liberty, than in the expression of their sense of sin; that their sacrifices, being free-will offerings, might be the more acceptable, while, by obliging them to bring the sacrifices of atonement, God shows the necessity of the great Propitiation. The main reason why blood was forbidden of old, was because the Lord had appointed blood for an atonement. This use, being figurative, had its end in Christ, who by his death and blood-shedding caused the sacrifices to cease. Therefore this law is not now in force on believers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Out of the whole oblation - Rather, out of each offering.

But if any part of it remained till the third day, it was, instead of being made use of, to be burned with fire. In the East, butcher-meat is generally eaten the day it is killed, and it is rarely kept a second day, so that as a prohibition was issued against any of the flesh in the peace offerings being used on the third day, it has been thought, not without reason, that this injunction must have been given to prevent a superstitious notion arising that there was some virtue or holiness belonging to it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By the priests and offerers this flesh was eaten, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-30.htm" title="On the same day it shall be eaten up; you shall leave none of it until the morrow: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 22:30</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving,....

Limits of time within which the Peace-Offerings must be consumed. When they are for thanksgiving, the whole of the flesh must be eaten on the day they are offered; before midnight is the traditional rule. A similar condition is prescribed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-18.htm" title="You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.">Exodus 23:18</a>, which is taken by some as referring to the festivals mentioned in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/7-14.htm" title="And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering to the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings....">Leviticus 7:14-17</a></span>; another view limits the injunction to the passover, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-25.htm" title="You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left to the morning.">Exodus 34:25</a>. In many ancient heathen rites, the flesh of the victim was consumed as soon as possible (<span class="ital">Rel. Sem</span>.2, p. 387). When the offering is made in fulfilment of a vow, or as a freewill offering (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-16.htm" title="But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:">Leviticus 7:16</a></span>), two days are allowed for consuming the remainder. In no case may the flesh be eaten on the third day (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/7-17.htm" title="But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire....">Leviticus 7:17-18</a></span>). Such eating rendered the sacrifice unacceptable, and the offerer had to bring a fresh sacrifice, while anyone so eating incurred punishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/19-6.htm" title="It shall be eaten the same day you offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire....">Leviticus 19:6-8</a>). The words following ‘the morrow’ in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-16.htm" title="But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:">Leviticus 7:16</a></span> are omitted in the LXX.; with this omission the passage more closely resembles <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-6.htm" title="It shall be eaten the same day you offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.">Leviticus 19:6</a> f.

This was probably the case also with the trespass-offerings and sin-offerings of the laity; whereas the skin of the peace-offerings belonged to the owner of the animal (see Mishnah, Sebach. 12, 3). - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-9.htm">Leviticus 7:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-10.htm">Leviticus 7:10</a>, the following law is laid down with reference to the meat-offering, that everything baked in the oven, and everything prepared in a pot or pan, was to belong to the priest, who burned a portion of it upon the altar; and that everything mixed with oil and everything dry was to belong to all the sons of Aaron, i.e., to all the priests, to one as much as another, so that they were all to receive an equal share. The reason for this distinction is not very clear. That all the meat-offerings described in ch. 2 should fall to the sons of Aaron (i.e., to the priests), with the exception of that portion which was burned upon the altar as an azcarah, followed from the fact that they were most holy (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>). As the meat-offerings, which consisted of pastry, and were offered in the form of prepared food (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-9.htm">Leviticus 7:9</a>), are the same as those described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-4.htm">Leviticus 2:4-8</a>, it is evident that by those mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-10.htm">Leviticus 2:10</a> we are to understand the kinds described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-14.htm">Leviticus 2:14-16</a>, and by the "dry," primarily the &#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;, which consisted of dried grains, to which oil was to be added (&#1504;&#1514;&#1503; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-15.htm">Leviticus 2:15</a>), though not poured upon it, as in the case of the offering of flour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>), and probably also in that of the sin-offerings and jealousy-offerings (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-11.htm">Leviticus 5:11</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-15.htm">Numbers 5:15</a>), which consisted simply of flour (without oil). The reason therefore why those which consisted of cake and pastry fell to the lot of the officiating priest, and those which consisted of flour mixed with oil, of dry corn, or of simple flour, were divided among all the priests, was probably simply this, that the former were for the most part offered only under special circumstances, and then merely in small quantities, whereas the latter were the ordinary forms in which the meat-offerings were presented, and amounted to more than the officiating priests could possibly consume, or dispose of by themselves. </body></html>
