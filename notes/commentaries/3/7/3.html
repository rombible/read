The former expressed repentance and sorrow for sin, therefore it was more proper to fast than feast; the peace-offerings denoted communion with a reconciled God in Christ, the joy and gratitude of a pardoned sinner, and the privileges of a true believer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-14.htm">Leviticus 5:14</a> note.

Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering&#8212;This chapter is a continuation of the laws that were to regulate the duty of the priests respecting the trespass offerings. The same regulations obtained in this case as in the burnt offerings&#8212;part was to be consumed on the altar, while the other part was a perquisite of the priests&#8212;some fell exclusively to the officiating minister, and was the fee for his services; others were the common share of all the priestly order, who lived upon them as their provision, and whose meetings at a common table would tend to promote brotherly harmony and friendship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof,....

The flesh of these sin-offerings was to be eaten by the priest who officiated at a holy place, in the fore-court (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-16.htm">Leviticus 6:16</a>). Whoever touched it became holy (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-18.htm">Leviticus 6:18</a>); and if any one sprinkled any of the blood upon his clothes, whatever the blood was sprinkled upon was to be washed in a holy place, in order that the most holy blood might not be carried out of the sanctuary into common life along with the sprinkled clothes, and thereby be profaned. The words "thou shalt wash" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-20.htm">Leviticus 6:20</a> are addressed to the priest. </body></html>
