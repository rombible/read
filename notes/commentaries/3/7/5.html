The former expressed repentance and sorrow for sin, therefore it was more proper to fast than feast; the peace-offerings denoted communion with a reconciled God in Christ, the joy and gratitude of a pardoned sinner, and the privileges of a true believer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-14.htm">Leviticus 5:14</a> note.

The same regulations obtained in this case as in the burnt offerings&#8212;part was to be consumed on the altar, while the other part was a perquisite of the priests&#8212;some fell exclusively to the officiating minister, and was the fee for his services; others were the common share of all the priestly order, who lived upon them as their provision, and whose meetings at a common table would tend to promote brotherly harmony and friendship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the priest shall burn them upon the altar,....
