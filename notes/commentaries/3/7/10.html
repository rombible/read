The former expressed repentance and sorrow for sin, therefore it was more proper to fast than feast; the peace-offerings denoted communion with a reconciled God in Christ, the joy and gratitude of a pardoned sinner, and the privileges of a true believer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the marginal references. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered&#8212;All the flesh and the fat of the burnt offerings being consumed, nothing remained to the priest but the skin.
