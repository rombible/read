The main reason why blood was forbidden of old, was because the Lord had appointed blood for an atonement. This use, being figurative, had its end in Christ, who by his death and blood-shedding caused the sacrifices to cease.

Whatever remained after that was to be burnt on the third day, i.e., to be destroyed by burning. If any was eaten on the third day, it was not well-pleasing (&#1497;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; "good pleasure," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-4.htm">Leviticus 1:4</a>), and was "not reckoned to the offerer," sc., as a sacrifice well-pleasing to God; it was "an abomination." &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, an abomination, is only applied to the flesh of the sacrifices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-7.htm">Leviticus 19:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-14.htm">Ezekiel 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-4.htm">Isaiah 65:4</a>), and signifies properly a stench; - compare the talmudic word &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; faetidum reddere. Whoever ate thereof would bear his sin (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>). "The soul that eateth" is not to be restricted, as Knobel supposes, to the other participators in the sacrificial meal, but applies to the offerer also, in fact to every one who partook of such flesh. The burning on the third day was commanded, not to compel the offerer to invite the poor to share in the meal (Theodoret, Clericus, etc.), but to guard against the danger of a desecration of the meal. The sacrificial flesh was holy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-34.htm">Exodus 29:34</a>); and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-8.htm">Leviticus 19:8</a>, where this command is repeated,<p>(Note: There is no foundation for Knobel's assertion, that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-5.htm">Leviticus 19:5</a>. another early lawgiver introduces a milder regulation with regard to the thank-offering, and allows all the thank-offerings to be eaten on the second day. For <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-5.htm">Leviticus 19:5</a>. does not profess to lay down a universal rule with regard to all the thank-offerings, but presupposes our law, and simply enforces its regulations with regard to the vow and freewill-offerings, and threatens transgressors with severe punishment.)<p>eating it on the third day is called a profanation of that which was holy to Jehovah, and ordered to be punished with extermination. It became a desecration of what was holy, through the fact that in warm countries, if flesh is not most carefully preserved by artificial means, it begins to putrefy, or becomes offensive (&#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;) on the third day. But to eat flesh that was putrid or stinking, would be like eating unclean carrion, or the &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492; with which putrid flesh is associated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-14.htm">Ezekiel 4:14</a>. It was for this reason that burning was commanded, as Philo (de vict. p. 842) and Maimonides (More Neboch iii. 46) admit; though the former also associates with this the purpose mentioned above, which we decidedly reject (cf. Outram l.c. p. 185 seq., and Bhr, ii. pp. 375-6). </body></html>
