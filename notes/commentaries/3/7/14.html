The main reason why blood was forbidden of old, was because the Lord had appointed blood for an atonement. This use, being figurative, had its end in Christ, who by his death and blood-shedding caused the sacrifices to cease.

The priest took one out of each ten, and the remainder belonged to the bringer of the sacrifice, to be eaten along with his share of the flesh of the Peace-Offering. These cakes were not treated as Meal-Offerings, for the priests claimed the whole of such offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-3.htm" title="And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.">Leviticus 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-10.htm" title="And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.">Leviticus 2:10</a>), but as an accompaniment of the Peace-Offering. Thus four of them were given as ‘<span class="ital">Tĕrûmah</span>’ to the Lord for the priest that threw the blood against the altar (see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-5.htm" title="And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about on the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 1:5</a>). ‘<span class="ital">Tĕrûmah</span>,’ ‘heave-offering,’ does not, however, indicate throwing, as the English word suggests, but something <span class="ital">lifted</span> or ‘taken off from a larger mass, and so separated from it for sacred purposes,’ and hence dedicated to God through His ministers.

This was probably the case also with the trespass-offerings and sin-offerings of the laity; whereas the skin of the peace-offerings belonged to the owner of the animal (see Mishnah, Sebach. 12, 3). - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-9.htm">Leviticus 7:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-10.htm">Leviticus 7:10</a>, the following law is laid down with reference to the meat-offering, that everything baked in the oven, and everything prepared in a pot or pan, was to belong to the priest, who burned a portion of it upon the altar; and that everything mixed with oil and everything dry was to belong to all the sons of Aaron, i.e., to all the priests, to one as much as another, so that they were all to receive an equal share. The reason for this distinction is not very clear. That all the meat-offerings described in ch. 2 should fall to the sons of Aaron (i.e., to the priests), with the exception of that portion which was burned upon the altar as an azcarah, followed from the fact that they were most holy (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>). As the meat-offerings, which consisted of pastry, and were offered in the form of prepared food (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-9.htm">Leviticus 7:9</a>), are the same as those described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-4.htm">Leviticus 2:4-8</a>, it is evident that by those mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-10.htm">Leviticus 2:10</a> we are to understand the kinds described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-14.htm">Leviticus 2:14-16</a>, and by the "dry," primarily the &#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;, which consisted of dried grains, to which oil was to be added (&#1504;&#1514;&#1503; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-15.htm">Leviticus 2:15</a>), though not poured upon it, as in the case of the offering of flour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>), and probably also in that of the sin-offerings and jealousy-offerings (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-11.htm">Leviticus 5:11</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-15.htm">Numbers 5:15</a>), which consisted simply of flour (without oil). The reason therefore why those which consisted of cake and pastry fell to the lot of the officiating priest, and those which consisted of flour mixed with oil, of dry corn, or of simple flour, were divided among all the priests, was probably simply this, that the former were for the most part offered only under special circumstances, and then merely in small quantities, whereas the latter were the ordinary forms in which the meat-offerings were presented, and amounted to more than the officiating priests could possibly consume, or dispose of by themselves. </body></html>
