The main reason why blood was forbidden of old, was because the Lord had appointed blood for an atonement. This use, being figurative, had its end in Christ, who by his death and blood-shedding caused the sacrifices to cease. Therefore this law is not now in force on believers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It was proper that the sacrificial meat should not be polluted by any approach to putrefaction. But the exclusion of a mean-spirited economy may further have furnished the ground for the distinction between the thank-offerings and the others. The most liberal distribution of the meat of the offering, particularly among the poor who were invited to partake, would plainly be becoming when the sacrifice was intended especially to express gratitude for mercies received. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. if any of the flesh of the sacrifice &#8230; be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither &#8230; imputed&#8212;The sacrifice will not be acceptable to God nor profitable to him that offers it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">It shall not be imputed unto him</span> for an acceptable service to God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And if any of the flesh of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day,....

To (lit., upon, in addition to) the sacrifice of thanksgiving (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12</a>, "sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace-offerings," <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-13.htm">Leviticus 7:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15</a>) they were to present "unleavened cakes kneaded with oil, and flat cakes anointed with oil (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-4.htm">Leviticus 2:4</a>), and roasted fine flour (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-14.htm">Leviticus 6:14</a>) mixed as cakes with oil," i.e., cakes made of fine flour roasted with oil, and thoroughly kneaded with oil (on the construction, see Ges. 139, 2; Ewald 284 a). This last kind of cakes kneaded with oil is also called oil-bread-cake ("a cake of oiled bread," <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-26.htm">Leviticus 8:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-23.htm">Exodus 29:23</a>), or "cake unleavened, kneaded with oil" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-2.htm">Exodus 29:2</a>), and probably differed from the former simply in the fact that it was more thoroughly saturated with oil, inasmuch as it was not only made of flour that had been mixed with oil in the kneading, but the flour itself was first of all roasted in oil, and then the dough was moistened still further with oil in the process of kneading. </body></html>
