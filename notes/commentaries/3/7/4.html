The former expressed repentance and sorrow for sin, therefore it was more proper to fast than feast; the peace-offerings denoted communion with a reconciled God in Christ, the joy and gratitude of a pardoned sinner, and the privileges of a true believer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-14.htm">Leviticus 5:14</a> note.

The same regulations obtained in this case as in the burnt offerings&#8212;part was to be consumed on the altar, while the other part was a perquisite of the priests&#8212;some fell exclusively to the officiating minister, and was the fee for his services; others were the common share of all the priestly order, who lived upon them as their provision, and whose meetings at a common table would tend to promote brotherly harmony and friendship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Which is by the flanks; </span> or, and that <span class="ital">which is</span>, &c.

The vessel, in which it was boiled for the priests to eat, was to be broken in pieces if it were of earthenware, and scoured (&#1502;&#1512;&#1511; Pual) and overflowed with water, i.e., thoroughly rinsed out, if it were of copper, lest any of the most holy flesh should adhere to the vessel, and be desecrated by its being used in the preparation of common food, or for other earthly purposes. It was possible to prevent this desecration in the case of copper vessels by a thorough cleansing; but not so with earthen vessels, which absorb the fat, so that it cannot be removed by washing. The latter therefore were to be broken in pieces, i.e., thoroughly destroyed. On the other hand, earthen vessels that had been defiled were also ordered to be broken to pieces, though for the very opposite reason (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-33.htm">Leviticus 11:33</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-35.htm">Leviticus 11:35</a>). </body></html>
