As in the case of the sin offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/4-24.htm" title="And he shall lay his hand on the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering.">Leviticus 4:24-31</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/6-24.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 6:24-30</a>) and the trespass offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/5-1.htm" title="And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness, whether he has seen or known of it; if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.">Leviticus 5:1-13</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/7-1.htm" title="Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most holy.">Leviticus 7:1-10</a>), so here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/7-11.htm" title="And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer to the LORD.">Leviticus 7:11-21</a>), we have more specific and fuller directions given to the priests with regard to the peace offerings, about which orders had previously been given to the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/3-1.htm" title="And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD.">Leviticus 3:1-15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Which he shall offer.</span>—That is, he who feels it his duty to offer it to the Lord. This common Hebrew idiom of using a verb with <span class= "ital">he </span>in it without an antecedent is better expressed in English by the impersonal, <span class= "ital">which one shall offer, </span>or by the passive, <span class= "ital">which shall be offered. </span>(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/7-20.htm" title="But the soul that eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain to the LORD, having his uncleanness on him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.">Leviticus 7:20-29</a>.) Three classes of peace offerings are specified—(1) an acknowledgment of mercies received, (2) as a vow offering, (3) as a freewill offering.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-11.htm" title="And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer to the LORD.">Leviticus 7:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">This is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings — </span>These are the only sort of offerings to be spoken of. There were several sorts of them, which required various rites. The first was a <span class="ital">gratulatory </span>offering, or a sacrifice of thanksgiving, so called because it was offered to God for some particular benefit received, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-12.htm" title="If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.">Leviticus 7:12</a>. Such sacrifices were accompanied with feasting, and sometimes with high demonstrations of joy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-15.htm" title="And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.">1 Samuel 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-6.htm" title="And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD to his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.">1 Kings 8:6</a>. Of these the psalmist speaks, when he says, <span class="ital">Let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing, </span><19A722><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-22.htm" title="And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.">Psalm 107:22</a>. The second was a <span class="ital">votive-offering, </span>or <span class="ital">vow, </span>being also a sacrifice of thanksgiving, but offered in consequence of a vow, or religious oath, whereby the party obliged himself to offer to God such a sacrifice, in case of receiving some particular benefit. The third was a <span class="ital">voluntary offering, </span>being a sacrifice freely made beforehand, in the nature of a prayer for obtaining some future blessing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-16.htm" title="But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:">Leviticus 7:16</a>; or, as Le Clerc explains it, a voluntary offering was a sacrifice offered, not for any particular benefit either received or expected, but merely from the overflowing of a heart grateful to God for his goodness in general. We find this oblation plainly distinguished from a votive-offering, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-23.htm" title="Either a bullock or a lamb that has any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that may you offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.">Leviticus 22:23</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:11-27 As to the peace-offerings, in the expression of their sense of mercy, God left them more at liberty, than in the expression of their sense of sin; that their sacrifices, being free-will offerings, might be the more acceptable, while, by obliging them to bring the sacrifices of atonement, God shows the necessity of the great Propitiation. The main reason why blood was forbidden of old, was because the Lord had appointed blood for an atonement. This use, being figurative, had its end in Christ, who by his death and blood-shedding caused the sacrifices to cease.

There are three sorts of peace offerings - thank offerings (verses 12-15), votive offerings, and voluntary offerings (verses 16-18). Of these, the thank offerings were made in thankful memorial for past mercies; votive offerings were made in fulfillment of a vow previously taken, that such offering should be presented if a terrain condition were fulfilled. Voluntary offerings differ from votive offerings by not having been previously vowed, and from thank offerings by not having reference to any special mercy received. The thank offering must be eaten by the offerer and his friends, on the same day that it was offered; the votive and the voluntary offerings, which were inferior to the thank offering in sanctity, on the same day or the next. The reason why a longer time was not given probably was that the more the meal was delayed, the less would a religious character be attached to it. The necessity of a quick consumption also took away the temptation of acting grudgingly towards those with whom the feast might be shared, and it likewise precluded the danger of the flesh becoming corrupted. If any of the flesh remained till the third day, it was to be <span class="cmt_word">burnt with fire</span>; if eaten on that day, it should not be <span class="cmt_word">accepted or imputed unto him that offered</span>, that is, it should not be regarded as a sacrifice of sweet savour to God, but an abomination (literally, <span class="accented">a stench</span>), and whoever ate it should <span class="cmt_word">bear his iniquity</span>, that is, should be guilty of an offense, requiring, probably, a sin offering to atone for it. The bread gift accompanying the animal sacrifice was to consist of three kinds of unleavened cakes, and one cake of leavened bread, and <span class="cmt_word">one out of the whole oblation</span>, that is, one cake of each kind, was to be offered by heaving and then given to the officiating priest, the remaining cakes forming a part of the offerer's festive meal. If any one took part of a feast on a peace offering while in a state of Levitical uncleanness, he was to be <span class="cmt_word">cut off from his people</span>, that is, excommunicated, without permission to recover immediate communion by offering a sin offering. St. Paul joined in a votive offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-26.htm">Acts 21:26</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The fat portions only were to be burned upon the altar, viz., the same as in the sin and peace-offerings (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-8.htm">Leviticus 4:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-9.htm">Leviticus 3:9</a>); but the flesh was to be eaten by the priests, as in the sin-offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-22.htm">Leviticus 6:22</a>), inasmuch as there was the same law in this respect for both the sin-offering and trespass-offering; and these parts of the sacrificial service must therefore have had the same meaning, every trespass being a sin (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-26.htm">Leviticus 6:26</a>). - Certain analogous instructions respecting the burnt-offering and meat-offering are appended in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-8.htm">Leviticus 7:8-10</a> by way of supplement, as they ought properly to have been given in ch. 6, in the laws relating to the sacrifices in question.</body></html>
