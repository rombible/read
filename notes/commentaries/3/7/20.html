The main reason why blood was forbidden of old, was because the Lord had appointed blood for an atonement. This use, being figurative, had its end in Christ, who by his death and blood-shedding caused the sacrifices to cease. Therefore this law is not now in force on believers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It was proper that the sacrificial meat should not be polluted by any approach to putrefaction. But the exclusion of a mean-spirited economy may further have furnished the ground for the distinction between the thank-offerings and the others. The most liberal distribution of the meat of the offering, particularly among the poor who were invited to partake, would plainly be becoming when the sacrifice was intended especially to express gratitude for mercies received. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. cut off from his people&#8212;that is, excluded from the privileges of an Israelite&#8212;lie under a sentence of excommunication.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The soul that eateth knowingly; </span> for if it were done ignorantly, a sacrifice was accepted for it, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-2.htm" title="Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcass of an unclean beast, or a carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.">Leviticus 5:2</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Having his uncleanness upon him, </span> i.e. not being cleansed from his uncleanness according to the appointment, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-24.htm" title="And for these you shall be unclean: whoever touches the carcass of them shall be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 11:24</a></span>, &c.

According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-9.htm">Leviticus 2:9</a>, an azcarah of the unleavened pastry was burned upon the altar, although this is not specially mentioned here any more than at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-9.htm">Leviticus 7:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-10.htm">Leviticus 7:10</a>; whereas none of the leavened bread-cake was placed upon the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-12.htm">Leviticus 2:12</a>), but it was simply used as bread for the sacrificial meal. There is nothing here to suggest an allusion to the custom of offering unleavened sacrificial cakes upon a plate of leavened dough, as J. D. Michaelis, Winer, and others suppose. </body></html>
