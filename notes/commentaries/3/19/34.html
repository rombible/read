It was this humane law which attracted so many strangers to Palestine. Hence we find that in the days of Solomon there were 153,600 strangers in the Holy Land.<p><span class= "bld">For ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.—</span>To enforce these kindly sentiments towards strangers, which was so contrary to the practice of the surrounding nations, who had an inveterate hatred of all foreigners, the lawgiver appeals to their own bitter experience. They knew with what inhumanity they were treated in Egypt because they were strangers, how they had been humiliated and reduced to slavery. The very thought of this will not only soften their hearts, but will enable them to see that the safety of all classes consists in basing our legislation upon the principle of equal rights to all inhabitants. This pathetic appeal is to be found three times more in the Pentateuch to enforce this precept (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-20.htm" title="He that sacrifices to any god, save to the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.">Exodus 22:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-9.htm" title="Also you shall not oppress a stranger: for you know the heart of a stranger, seeing you were strangers in the land of Egypt.">Exodus 23:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-19.htm" title="Love you therefore the stranger: for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.">Deuteronomy 10:19</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-34.htm" title="But the stranger that dwells with you shall be to you as one born among you, and you shall love him as yourself; for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 19:34</a></span>. <span class="ital">As one born among you </span>— Either, 1st, As to the matters of common right, so it reached to all strangers.

It is required that Israel be a holy people, because the God of Israel is a holy God, ver. 2. To teach real separation from the world and the flesh, and entire devotedness to God. This is now the law of Christ; may the Lord bring every thought within us into obedience to it! Children are to be obedient to their parents, ver. 3. The fear here required includes inward reverence and esteem, outward respect and obedience, care to please them and to make them easy. God only is to be worshipped, ver. 4. Turn not from the true God to false ones, from the God who will make you holy and happy, to those that will deceive you, and make you for ever miserable. Turn not your eyes to them, much less your heart. They should leave the gleanings of their harvest and vintage for the poor, ver. 9. Works of piety must be always attended with works of charity, according to our ability. We must not be covetous, griping, and greedy of every thing we can lay claim to, nor insist upon our right in all things. We are to be honest and true in all our dealings, ver. 11. Whatever we have in the world, we must see that we get it honestly, for we cannot be truly rich, or long rich, with that which is not so. Reverence to the sacred name of God must be shown, ver. 12. We must not detain what belongs to another, particularly the wages of the hireling, ver. 13. We must be tender of the credit and safety of those that cannot help themselves, ver. 14. Do no hurt to any, because they are unwilling or unable to avenge themselves. We ought to take heed of doing any thing which may occasion our weak brother to fall. The fear of God should keep us from doing wrong things, though they will not expose us to men's anger. Judges, and all in authority, are commanded to give judgment without partiality, ver. 15. To be a tale-bearer, and to sow discord among neighbours, is as bad an office as a man can put himself into. We are to rebuke our neighbour in love, ver. 17. Rather rebuke him than hate him, for an injury done to thyself. We incur guilt by not reproving; it is hating our brother. We should say, I will do him the kindness to tell him of his faults. We are to put off all malice, and to put on brotherly love, ver. 18. We often wrong ourselves, but we soon forgive ourselves those wrongs, and they do not at all lessen our love to ourselves; in like manner we should love our neighbour. We must in many cases deny ourselves for the good of our neighbour. Ver. 31: For Christians to have their fortunes told, to use spells and charms, or the like, is a sad affront to God. They must be grossly ignorant who ask, What harm is there in these things? Here is a charge to young people to show respect to the aged, ver. 32. Religion teaches good manners, and obliges us to honour those to whom honour is due. A charge was given to the Israelites to be very tender of strangers, ver. 33. Strangers, and the widows and fatherless, are God's particular care. It is at our peril, if we do them any wrong. Strangers shall be welcome to God's grace; we should do what we can to recommend religion to them. Justice in weights and measures is commanded, ver. 35. We must make conscience of obeying God's precepts. We are not to pick and choose our duty, but must aim at standing complete in all the will of God. And the nearer our lives and tempers are to the precepts of God's law, the happier shall we be, and the happier shall we make all around us, and the better shall we adorn the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The stranger - The foreigner.

Two prohibitions of an unnatural disfigurement of the body. The first refers to passionate outbursts of mourning, common among the excitable nations of the East, particularly in the southern parts, and to the custom of scratching the arms, hands, and face (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>), which is said to have prevailed among the Babylonians and Armenians (Cyrop. iii. 1, 13, iii. 3, 67), the Scythians (Herod. 4, 71), and even the ancient Romans (cf. M. Geier de Ebraeor. luctu, c. 10), and to be still practised by the Arabs (Arvieux Beduinen, p. 153), the Persians (Morier Zweite Reise, p. 189), and the Abyssinians of the present day, and which apparently held its ground among the Israelites notwithstanding the prohibition (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-6.htm">Jeremiah 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-5.htm">Jeremiah 41:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-5.htm">Jeremiah 47:5</a>), - as well as to the custom, which is also forbidden in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>, of cutting off the hair of the head and beard (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-12.htm">Isaiah 22:12</a>; Micah.

It cannot be inferred from the words of Plutarch, quoted by Spencer, &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, that the heathen associated with this custom the idea of making an expiation to the dead. The prohibition of &#1511;&#1506;&#1511;&#1506; &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;&#1514;, scriptio stigmatis, writing corroded or branded (see Ges. thes. pp. 1207-8), i.e., of tattooing, - a custom not only very common among the savage tribes, but still met with in Arabia (Arvieux Beduinen, p. 155; Burckhardt Beduinen, pp. 40, 41) and in Egypt among both men and women of the lower orders (Lane, Manners and Customs i. pp. 25, 35, iii. p. 169), - had no reference to idolatrous usages, but was intended to inculcate upon the Israelites a proper reverence for God's creation.</body></html>
