This clause defines the preceding one, stating more minutely what the issue consists of and proceeds from.<p><span class= "bld">She shall be put apart seven days.</span>—Though as a rule the discharge ceases after three or four days, yet, as in the first stage after childbirth, the period of uncleanness is extended to seven days to include exceptional cases. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.">Leviticus 12:2</a>.) To fully appreciate the merciful provisions of the laws here enacted, it is necessary to bear in mind not only the gross superstitions which obtained among the ancients about women in this condition, but the cruel treatment to which wives and daughters were subjected, and in some countries both in the Old and New Worlds still are subjected. It was believed that if a woman in this condition sat under a tree, all its fruit fell off; at her approach the edge of a tool became blunted, and copper utensils contracted a fetid smell, and meat got sour, and a thousand other things. Hence the Parsees not only isolated her from the rest of the family, but forbade her speaking to any one, and those who took food to her in her seclusion had to put it at some distance from her. The Zabii purified with fire every place which she trod. Even if the wind which came from the quarter where she was blew upon any one, he became polluted. To this day the  in Issing, the Calmucks, and many others, have special houses for them outside each town and village; and at the River La Plata they are sewn into hammocks, with only a small aperture for the mouth, till they are well again. To restrain the Jews from sharing these superstitions, and from resorting to any of these inhuman acts, as well as for sanitary purposes, the Lawgiver ordained these benign and necessary rules.<p><span class= "bld">Whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean.</span>—Like other unclean persons, she defiled by being touched. Though not expressed here, it is implied that he who contracted this defilement had both to wash his garments and bathe his body as usual.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-19.htm" title="And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whoever touches her shall be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">She shall be put apart — </span>Not out of the camp, but from converse with her husband and others, and from access to the house of God. <span class="ital">Seven days — </span>During the time of her infirmity, which might perhaps continue so long, and it was decent to allow time for her purification after the ceasing of her issue. <span class="ital">Whosoever toucheth her — </span>Of grown persons; for the infant, to whom in that case she might give suck, was exempted from this pollution by the greater law of necessity, and by that antecedent law, which required women to give suck to their own children.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-33 Laws concerning ceremonial uncleanness. - We need not be curious in explaining these laws; but have reason to be thankful that we need fear no defilement, except that of sin, nor need ceremonial and burdensome purifications.

Having finished, as Aben Ezra observes, what was to be said of the male, now the Scripture begins with the female, whose issue, of a different sort, is thus described: <p>and her issue in her flesh be blood; or, "blood be her issue in her flesh"; not in any part of her, but in that which by an euphemism is so called, in the same sense as the phrase is used of men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-2.htm">Leviticus 15:2</a>; and so it distinguishes it from any flow of blood elsewhere, as a bleeding at the nose, &amp;c. <p>she shall be put apart seven days; not out of the camp, nor out of the house, but might not go into the house of God: <p>whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even; the same as one that had touched a man that had an issue, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-7.htm">Leviticus 15:7</a>; the pollution of the one reached to the same things as that of the other; and so, in the Misnah (h), they are put together, and the same is ascribed to the touch of the one as of the other; it may be understood of everything as well as of every person. <p>(h) Zabim, c. 5. sect. 6, 7. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/leviticus/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="ital">As regards women</span> (19–30)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">19–24</span>.
