He had to wash his clothes and immerse the whole of his body in water before he could be admitted into the enjoyment of his own sacred privileges.<span class= "bld"><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-33 Laws concerning ceremonial uncleanness. - We need not be curious in explaining these laws; but have reason to be thankful that we need fear no defilement, except that of sin, nor need ceremonial and burdensome purifications. These laws remind us that God sees all things, even those which escape the notice of men. The great gospel duties of faith and repentance are here signified, and the great gospel privileges of the application of Christ's blood to our souls for our justification, and his grace for our sanctification.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This chapter would seem to take its place more naturally before <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-1.htm">Leviticus 12:1-8</a>, with the subject of which it is inmediately connected.

When any man hath a running issue&#8212;This chapter describes other forms of uncleanness, the nature of which is sufficiently intelligible in the text without any explanatory comment. Being the effects of licentiousness, they properly come within the notice of the legislator, and the very stringent rules here prescribed, both for the separation of the person diseased and for avoiding contamination from anything connected with him, were well calculated not only to prevent contagion, but to discourage the excesses of licentious indulgence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He that toucheth the flesh, </span> that is, any part of his body; the word flesh being taken otherwise here than <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When any man has a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.">Leviticus 15:2</a></span>; as the same word is frequently used in Scripture in differing significations in the same chapter, and sometimes in the same verse, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-22.htm" title="But Jesus said to him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.">Matthew 8:22</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue,....
