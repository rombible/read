Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness&#8212;The divine wisdom was manifested in inspiring the Israelites with a profound reverence for holy things; and nothing was more suited to this purpose than to debar from the tabernacle all who were polluted by any kind of uncleanness, ceremonial as well as natural, mental as well as physical. The better to mark out that people as His family, His servants and priests, dwelling in the camp as in a holy place, consecrated by His presence and His tabernacle, He required of them complete purity, and did not allow them to come before Him when defiled, even by involuntary or secret impurities, as a want of respect due to His majesty. And when we bear in mind that God was training a people to live in His presence in some measure as priests devoted to His service, we shall not consider these rules for the maintenance of personal purity either too stringent or too minute (1Th 4:4).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When they defile my tabernacle; </span> which they did both ceremonially, by coming into it in their uncleanness, and morally, by the gross neglect and contempt of God’s express and positive command to cleanse themselves. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness,....

In Exodus 25-27, and in parts of 35–40 the word is used to denote the structure described in 26, 36, and distinguished as the ‘tabernacle’ from the ‘tent over the tabernacle’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-7.htm" title="And you shall make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering on the tabernacle: eleven curtains shall you make.">Exodus 26:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/36-14.htm" title="And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.">Exodus 36:14</a> in R.V.). But in other passages it is used as the equivalent of the ‘tent of meeting’ for the tabernacle with its covering tent. It indicates the place where God dwells among the children of Israel according to His promise (so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-16.htm" title="And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remains among them in the middle of their uncleanness.">Leviticus 16:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-11.htm" title="And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.">Leviticus 26:11</a> f.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-45.htm" title="And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.">Exodus 29:45</a>; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-8.htm" title="And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.">Exodus 25:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-3.htm" title="Both male and female shall you put out, without the camp shall you put them; that they defile not their camps, in the middle whereof I dwell.">Numbers 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-34.htm" title="Defile not therefore the land which you shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.">Numbers 35:34</a>), and is used only of the tabernacle1[52] (in the plur., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-5.htm" title="How goodly are your tents, O Jacob, and your tabernacles, O Israel!">Numbers 24:5</a>, it is used of Israel in poetical parallelism with ‘tents’).
