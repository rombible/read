The patient’s polluting power is so great that even if the bed, seat, or saddle is under a stone, he defiles it through the stone by any of these actions. If he stood upon two beds, placing one foot upon each, he defiled both.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-4.htm" title="Every bed, where on he lies that has the issue, is unclean: and every thing, where on he sits, shall be unclean.">Leviticus 15:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Every bed whereon he lieth, </span>&c. — Thus, such persons were cut off from all communications with mankind, and were shunned and avoided by every one, as an abomination.

These laws remind us that God sees all things, even those which escape the notice of men. The great gospel duties of faith and repentance are here signified, and the great gospel privileges of the application of Christ's blood to our souls for our justification, and his grace for our sanctification.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This chapter would seem to take its place more naturally before <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-1.htm">Leviticus 12:1-8</a>, with the subject of which it is inmediately connected.

When any man hath a running issue&#8212;This chapter describes other forms of uncleanness, the nature of which is sufficiently intelligible in the text without any explanatory comment. Being the effects of licentiousness, they properly come within the notice of the legislator, and the very stringent rules here prescribed, both for the separation of the person diseased and for avoiding contamination from anything connected with him, were well calculated not only to prevent contagion, but to discourage the excesses of licentious indulgence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Every thing, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">vessel</span>, by which the Hebrews understand all sorts of household stuff. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Every bed whereon he lieth that hath the issue is unclean,....
