The authorities during the second Temple defined the words which are translated “usury” (<span class= "ital">nesheck</span>) and “increase” (<span class= "ital">tarbith, </span>or <span class= "ital">marbith</span>) as follows: If a person lends to another a shekel worth four denarii, and gets in return five denarii, or if he lends him two sacks of wheat, and receives back three, this is usury. If one buys wheat for delivery at the market price of 25 denarii a measure, and when it rises to 30 denarii he says to the vendor, “Deliver me the wheat, for I want to sell it and buy wine,” and the vendor replies,” I will take the wheat at 30 denarii and give thee wine for it,” though he has no wine, this is increase. The “increase” lies in the fact that the vendor has no wine at the time, and that he may possibly lose again by the rise in wine. Accordingly the former is a charge upon money, whilst the latter is on products.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-36.htm" title="Take you no usury of him, or increase: but fear your God; that your brother may live with you.">Leviticus 25:36</a></span>. <span class="ital">Take no usury of him — </span>That is, of thy brother, whether he be Israelite or proselyte. <span class="ital">Or increase — </span>All kinds of usury are in this case forbidden, whether of money, or of victuals, or of any thing that is commonly lent by one man to another upon usury, or upon condition of receiving the thing lent with advantage and overplus.

For there it is reasonable that the lender should share with the borrower in the profit.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:35-38 Poverty and decay are great grievances, and very common; the poor ye have always with you. Thou shalt relieve him; by sympathy, pitying the poor; by service, doing for them; and by supply, giving to them according to their necessity, and thine ability. Poor debtors must not be oppressed. Observe the arguments here used against extortion: Fear thy God. Relieve the poor, that they may live with thee; for they may be serviceable to thee. The rich can as ill spare the poor, as the poor can the rich.

Whether a native Israelite or a mere sojourner, his richer neighbor was required to give him food, lodging, and a supply of money without usury. Usury was severely condemned (Ps 15:5; Eze 18:8, 17), but the prohibition cannot be considered as applicable to the modern practice of men in business, borrowing and lending at legal rates of interest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Of thy brother, whether he be Israelite or proselyte. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Increase:</span> this some conceive relates to the fruits of the earth, food, &c., as <span class="ital">usury</span> doth to money.

This law is founded upon the assumption, that the houses in unwalled towns are not so closely connected with the ownership of the land, as that the alienation of the houses would alter the portion originally assigned to each family for a possession. Having been built by men, they belonged to their owners in full possession, whether they had received them just as they were at the conquest of the land, or had erected them for themselves. This last point of view, however, was altogether a subordinate one; for in the case of "the houses of the villages" (i.e., farm-buildings and villages, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-23.htm">Joshua 13:23</a>, etc.), which had no walls round them, it was not taken into consideration at all.</body></html>
