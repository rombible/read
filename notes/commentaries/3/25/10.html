Hence as new year was with the Hebrews the preparation for the Day of Atonement, so it also became the prelude to the acts of mercy which finally came into operation on the Day of Atonement. They therefore began counting the cycle of the jubile from the first of Tishri, or new year, though they proclaimed it on the tenth, or on the close of the Day of Atonement. In accordance with this the authorities during the second Temple record that “from the Feast of Trumpets <span class= "ital">[i.e., </span>Tishri 1] till the Day of Atonement <span class= "ital">[i.e., </span>Tishri 10], the slaves were neither manumitted to return to their homes, nor were made use of by their masters, but ate, drank, rejoiced, and wore garlands; and when the Day of Atonement came the judges blew the cornet, the slaves were manumitted to return to their homes, and the fields were set free.”<p><span class= "bld">And proclaim liberty . . . unto all the inhabitants</span>—That is, to all the Israelites, who are the true possessors of the land. Hence the ancient authorities conclude that the law of jubile was only in force as long as the whole Jewish nation dwelt in the land, but not after the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, were carried into captivity by Pul and Tilgath-Pilneser kings of Assyria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-26.htm" title="And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, to this day.">1Chronicles 5:26</a>), because “all the inhabitants” of the land dwelt no longer in it. It is from this declaration to proclaim liberty that the year of jubile is also called “the year of freedom” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-17.htm" title="But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons' for them.">Ezekiel 46:17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">It shall be a jubile.</span>—This is an abbreviation of the fuller form, “a year of jubile,” used in the other passages of this chapter (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-13.htm" title="In the year of this jubilee you shall return every man to his possession.">Leviticus 25:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-28.htm" title="But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that has bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession.">Leviticus 25:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-40.htm" title="But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with you, and shall serve you to the year of jubilee.">Leviticus 25:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-50.htm" title="And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him to the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.">Leviticus 25:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-52.htm" title="And if there remain but few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall count with him, and according to his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.">Leviticus 25:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-54.htm" title="And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, both he, and his children with him.">Leviticus 25:54</a>), and denotes “a year proclaimed by the blast of the horn,” since the word <span class= "ital">yôbel </span>signifies both ram’s horn and the sound emitted from it.<p><span class= "bld">And ye shall return every man.</span>—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/25-14.htm" title="And if you sell ought to your neighbor, or buy ought of your neighbor's hand, you shall not oppress one another:">Leviticus 25:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/25-23.htm" title="The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for you are strangers and sojourners with me.">Leviticus 25:23-28</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Every man unto his family.</span>—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/25-39.htm" title="And if your brother that dwells by you be waxen poor, and be sold to you; you shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant:">Leviticus 25:39-40</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-10.htm" title="And you shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee to you; and you shall return every man to his possession, and you shall return every man to his family.">Leviticus 25:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">The fiftieth year — </span>The year of jubilee was not the forty and ninth year, as some learned men have erroneously thought, but precisely the fiftieth.

This sound was to be made on the evening of the great day of atonement; for the proclamation of gospel liberty and salvation results from the sacrifice of the Redeemer. It was provided that the lands should not be sold away from their families. They could only be disposed of, as it were, by leases till the year of jubilee, and then returned to the owner or his heir. This tended to preserve their tribes and families distinct, till the coming of the Messiah. The liberty every man was born to, if sold or forfeited, should return at the year of jubilee. This was typical of redemption by Christ from the slavery of sin and Satan, and of being brought again to the liberty of the children of God. All bargains ought to be made by this rule, Ye shall not oppress one another, not take advantage of one another's ignorance or necessity, but thou shalt fear thy God. The fear of God reigning in the heart, would restrain from doing wrong to our neighbour in word or deed. Assurance was given that they should be great gainers, by observing these years of rest. If we are careful to do our duty, we may trust God with our comfort. This was a miracle for an encouragement to all neither sowed or reaped. This was a miracle for an encouragement to all God's people, in all ages, to trust him in the way of duty. There is nothing lost by faith and self-denial in obedience. Some asked, What shall we eat the seventh year? Thus many Christians anticipate evils, questioning what they shall do, and fearing to proceed in the way of duty. But we have no right to anticipate evils, so as to distress ourselves about them. To carnal minds we may appear to act absurdly, but the path of duty is ever the path of safety.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The fiftieth year - The Jubilee probably coincided with each seventh sabbatical year, and was called the fiftieth, as being the last of a series of which the first was the preceding Jubilee.<p>A jubile - Commonly spelled jubilee. The original word first occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-13.htm">Exodus 19:13</a>, where it is rendered "trumpet," margin "cornet." It most probably denotes the sound of the cornet, not the cornet itself, and is derived from a root, signifying to flow abundantly, which by a familiar metaphor might be applied to sound. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. ye shall hallow the fiftieth year&#8212;Much difference of opinion exists as to whether the jubilee was observed on the forty-ninth, or, in round numbers, it is called the fiftieth. The prevailing opinion, both in ancient and modern times, has been in favor of the latter.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By which it seems most probable that the year of jubilee was not the forty and ninth year, as some learned men think, but precisely the fiftieth year; which may appear, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Because the Jews account it so, which is confessed by the adversaries of this opinion, who say that <span class="ital">the Jews err in the computation of the jubilee, as they do in Christ</span>, <span class="ital">the great end and antitype of the jubilee</span>. But it is not probable that the Jews should universally err in a matter of constant practice among themselves, especially when there was nothing of interest or prejudice in the case, as there was in reference to Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Because it is expressly called the fiftieth year here, and <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-11.htm" title="A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be to you: you shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of your vine undressed.">Leviticus 25:11</a></span>, <span class="ital">that fiftieth year</span>, which was not true if it was but the nine and fortieth year. It is said it is called so popularly, and it was so if you take in the foregoing jubilee. But it must be remembered, that there was not yet any foregoing jubilee, but the very first of the kind is expressly called <span class="ital">the fiftieth year</span>, which in truth it was not if the jubilee was ended ere the fiftieth year began. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. From the common course of computation. The old weekly sabbath is called <span class="ital">the seventh day</span>, because it truly was so, being next after the six days of the week, and distinct from them all; and the year of release is called the <span class="ital">seventh year</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-4.htm" title="But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest to the land, a sabbath for the LORD: you shall neither sow your field, nor prune your vineyard.">Leviticus 25:4</a></span>, as immediately following the six years, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-3.htm" title="Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;">Leviticus 25:3</a></span>, and distinct from them all. And therefore, in like manner, the jubilee must needs be called <span class="ital">the fiftieth year</span>, because it comes next after <span class="ital">seven times seven</span>, or forty-nine <span class="ital">years</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-8.htm" title="And you shall number seven sabbaths of years to you, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be to you forty and nine years.">Leviticus 25:8</a></span>, and is distinct from them all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. From <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-11.htm" title="A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be to you: you shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of your vine undressed.">Leviticus 25:11</a>,12</span>, where it is said, <span class="ital">ye shall not sow, nor reap</span>, &c; <span class="ital">for it is the jubilee</span>, &c.; which looks like a vain and useless repetition, if this year were but one of the seven years, for this very command was given concerning every seventh year, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-4.htm" title="But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest to the land, a sabbath for the LORD: you shall neither sow your field, nor prune your vineyard.">Leviticus 25:4</a></span>; but if this year of jubilee was, as indeed it was, a year distinct from and coming after the seven sevens of years, then this repetition and application of that command to it was highly necessary, because otherwise it might seem hard and unreasonable that they should forbear sowing and reaping two years together, which hereby they are commanded to do. Two things are objected against this: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That the jubilee was only a revolution of forty-nine years. But that seems a great mistake, for it is most expressly distinguished from them all, and by way of distinction called <span class="ital">the fiftieth year</span>, therefore surely none of the forty-nine. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The difficulty propounded <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-20.htm" title="And if you shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:">Leviticus 25:20</a></span> concerns only the seventh year, whereas it had been a greater difficulty if it had been extended to the jubilee, and the jubilee had been another vacant year coming next after the seventh year. But though the difficulty was greater for the jubilee, yet it was more frequent for the seventh year; and the resolution of the one made the way plan for the satisfaction of the other. For as God promised so to bless every sixth year, that it should bring forth fruit for three years, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-21.htm" title="Then I will command my blessing on you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.">Leviticus 25:21</a></span>; so when the case was extraordinary, as in the jubilee, it was but reasonable to expect an extraordinary blessing from God upon that sixth year which went next before the last of the seventh years, or the forty-ninth year, that it should then bring forth fruit for four years. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">All the inhabitants thereof</span>: understand such as were Israelites; principally to all servants, even to such as would not and did not go out at the seventh year, and to the poor, who now were acquitted from all their debts, and restored to their possessions. <span class="ital">A jubilee</span>; so called, either from the Hebrew word <span class="ital">jobel</span>, which signifies first a <span class="ital">ram</span>, and then a <span class="ital">ram’s horn</span>, by the sound whereof it was proclaimed; or from Jubal, the inventor of musical instruments, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-21.htm" title="And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.">Genesis 4:21</a></span>, because it was celebrated with music and all expressions of joy. <span class="ital">Every man unto his possession</span>, which had been sold, or otherwise alienated from him. This law was not at all unjust, because all buyers and sellers had an eye to this condition in their bargains; but it was necessary and expedient in many regards; as, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. To mind them that God alone was the Lord and Owner and Proprietor both of them and of their lands, and they only his tenants and farmers; a point which they were very apt to forget. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That hereby inheritances, families, and tribes might be kept entire and clear until the coming of the Messias, who was to be known, as by other things, so by the tribe and family out of which he was to come. And this accordingly was done by the singular providence of God until the Lord Jesus did come. Since which time those characters are miserably confounded; which is no small argument that the Messias is come. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. To set bounds both to the insatiable avarice of some, and the foolish prodigality of others, that the former might not wholly and finally swallow up the inheritances of their brethren, and the latter might not be able to undo themselves and their posterity for ever, which was a singular privilege of this law and people. <span class="ital">Every man unto his family</span>, from whom he was gone, being sold to some other family, either by himself or by his father. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year,.... The year following the seven sabbaths of years, or forty nine years; and which they were to sanctify by separating it from all others, and devoting it to the uses it was to be put to, and the services done on it, and by abstaining from the tillage of the land, sowing or reaping, and from the cultivation of vines, olives, &amp;c. <p>and proclaim liberty throughout all the land; to servants, both to those whose ears were bored, and were to serve for ever, even unto the year of jubilee, and then be released; and to those whose six years were not ended, from the time that they were bought; for the jubilee year put an end to their servitude, let the time they had served be what it would; for this year was a general release of servants, excepting bondmen and bondmaids, who were never discharged; hence called the "year of liberty", <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-17.htm">Ezekiel 46:17</a>; and Josephus (w) says, the word "jobel" or "jubilee" signifies "liberty": <p>unto all the inhabitants thereof; that were in servitude or poverty, excepting the above mentioned; from hence the Jews gather, than when the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, went into captivity, the jubilees ceased (x), since all the inhabitants were not then in it; but that is a mistake, for the jubilees were continued unto the coming of the Messiah, and perhaps never omitted but once, in the time of the Babylonish captivity: <p>it shall be a jubilee unto you; to the Israelites, and to them only, as Aben Ezra observes; it was a time of joy and gladness to them, especially to servants, who were now free, and to the poor, who enjoyed their estates again: <p>and ye shall return every man unto his possession; which had been sold or mortgaged to another, but now reverted to its original owner: <p>and ye shall return every man unto his family; who through poverty had sold himself for a servant, and had lived in another family. The general design of this law was to preserve the rights of freeborn Israelites, as to person and property, to prevent perpetual servitude, and perpetual alienation of their estates; to continue families and estates as they were originally, that some might not become too rich, and others too poor; nor be blended, but the tribes and families might be kept distinct until the coming of the Messiah, to whom the jubilee had a particular respect, and in whom it ceased. The liberty proclaimed on this day was typical of that liberty from the bondage of sin, Satan, and the law, which Christ is the author of, and is proclaimed by him in the Gospel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>; a liberty of grace and glory, or the glorious liberty of the children of God: returning to possessions and inheritances may be an emblem of the enjoyment of the heavenly inheritance by the saints; though man by sin lost an earthly paradise, and came short of the glory of God, yet through Christ his people are restored to a better inheritance, an incorruptible one; to which they are begotten by his Spirit, have a right to it through his righteousness, and a meetness for it by his grace, and of which the Holy Spirit is the earnest and pledge, and into which Christ himself will introduce them. And the returning of them to their families may signify the return of God's elect through Christ to the family that is named of him; these were secretly of the family of God from all eternity, being taken into it in the covenant of grace, as well as predestinated to the adoption of children: but by the fall, and through a state of nature by it, they became children of wrath, even as others; yet through redemption by Christ, and faith in him, they receive the adoption of children, and openly appear to be of the family of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-18.htm">2 Corinthians 6:18</a>; and all this is proclaimed by the sound of the Gospel trumpet, which being a sound of liberty, peace, pardon, righteousness, salvation, and eternal life by Christ, is a joyful one, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-15.htm">Psalm 89:15</a>; where the allusion seems to be to the jubilee trumpet. <p>(w) Antiqu. l. 3. c. 12. sect. 3.((x) Maimon. &amp; Bartenora in Misn.

Six years they were to sow the field and cut the vineyard, i.e., cultivate the corn-fields, vineyards, and olive-yards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-11.htm">Exodus 23:11</a> : see the remarks on cerem at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-10.htm">Leviticus 19:10</a>), and gather in their produce; but in the seventh year the land was to keep a Sabbath of rest (Sabbath sabbathon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-15.htm">Exodus 31:15</a>), a Sabbath consecrated to the Lord (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>); and in this year the land was neither to be tilled nor reaped (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-10.htm">Exodus 23:10-11</a>). &#1494;&#1502;&#1512; in Kal applies only to the cutting of grapes, and so also in Niphal, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>; hence zemorah, a vine-branch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-23.htm">Numbers 13:23</a>), and mazmerah, a pruning-knife (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>, etc.).<p>(Note: The meaning to sin and play, which is peculiar to the Piel, and is derived from zamar, to hum, has hardly anything to do with this.
