The plot which should thus come into the possession of each family is to be absolutely inalienable, and for ever continue to be the property of the descendants of the original possessor. Hence it is here enacted that where a proprietor being pressed by poverty is compelled to sell a field, it could not be bought of him for a longer period than up to the time of the next jubile, when it reverted to the original possessor, or to his family. In purchasing a plot of and the purchaser is to reckon how many years had elapsed since the last jubile, since this would show him the exact period during which he would be entitled to hold it. It thus corresponds to what with us is buying the unexpired term of a lease.<p><span class= "bld">Of thy neighbour.</span>—From this it was deduced that the Israelite who was reduced to poverty could only sell his land to a fellow-Israelite, but not to a Gentile.<p><span class= "bld">The number of years of the fruit he shall sell.</span>—Whilst the purchaser is to take into consideration the number of years which the lease has still to run, the vendor has to consider how many sabbatical years there will be from the time of the sale till next jubile, since the sale was not so much of the land as of the produce of so many years. Hence the fallow sabbatical years are not to be included. As the plural “number of years “is here used, the authorities during the second Temple concluded that the vendor could not sell it for less than <span class= "ital">two productive years, </span>exclusive of a sabbatical year, a year of barrenness, and of the first harvest if the purchase was effected shortly before the seventh month, with the ripe produce in the field.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-15.htm" title="According to the number of years after the jubilee you shall buy of your neighbor, and according to the number of years of the fruits he shall sell to you:">Leviticus 25:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">According to the number of years — thou shalt buy </span>— The purchase of all lands, houses, or estates, was to be at a price proportionable to the greater or less number of years that remained from the time of the purchase to the next jubilee. <span class="ital">Years of fruits — </span>Years in which, having sowed, they reaped the fruits of the land, in opposition to those years in which they were neither allowed to sow nor reap.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:8-22 The word jubilee signifies a peculiarly animated sound of the silver trumpets. This sound was to be made on the evening of the great day of atonement; for the proclamation of gospel liberty and salvation results from the sacrifice of the Redeemer. It was provided that the lands should not be sold away from their families. They could only be disposed of, as it were, by leases till the year of jubilee, and then returned to the owner or his heir. This tended to preserve their tribes and families distinct, till the coming of the Messiah. The liberty every man was born to, if sold or forfeited, should return at the year of jubilee. This was typical of redemption by Christ from the slavery of sin and Satan, and of being brought again to the liberty of the children of God. All bargains ought to be made by this rule, Ye shall not oppress one another, not take advantage of one another's ignorance or necessity, but thou shalt fear thy God. The fear of God reigning in the heart, would restrain from doing wrong to our neighbour in word or deed. Assurance was given that they should be great gainers, by observing these years of rest. If we are careful to do our duty, we may trust God with our comfort. This was a miracle for an encouragement to all neither sowed or reaped. This was a miracle for an encouragement to all God's people, in all ages, to trust him in the way of duty. There is nothing lost by faith and self-denial in obedience. Some asked, What shall we eat the seventh year? Thus many Christians anticipate evils, questioning what they shall do, and fearing to proceed in the way of duty. But we have no right to anticipate evils, so as to distress ourselves about them. To carnal minds we may appear to act absurdly, but the path of duty is ever the path of safety.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The number of years of the fruits - i. e. according to the number of harvests.

Seven Sabbaths of years - i.e., year-Sabbaths or sabbatical years, or seven times seven years, the time of seven year-Sabbaths, that is to say, 49 years - they were to count, and then at the expiration of that time to cause the trumpet of jubilee to go (sound) through the whole land on the tenth of the seventh month, i.e., the day of atonement, to proclaim the entrance of the year of jubilee. This mode of announcement was closely connected with the idea of the year itself. The blowing of trumpets, or blast of the far-sounding horn (shophar, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-24.htm">Leviticus 23:24</a>), was the signal of the descent of the Lord upon Sinai, to raise Israel to be His people, to receive them into His covenant, to unite them to Himself, and bless them through His covenant of grace (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-13.htm">Exodus 19:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-19.htm">Exodus 19:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18</a>). Just as the people were to come up to the mountain at the sounding of the &#1497;&#1493;&#1489;&#1500;, or the voice of the shophar, to commemorate its union with the Lord, so at the expiration of the seventh sabbatical year the trumpet-blast was to announce to the covenant nation the gracious presence of its God, and the coming of the year which was to bring "liberty throughout the land to all that dwelt therein" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>), - deliverance from bondage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-40.htm">Leviticus 25:40</a>.), return to their property and family (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-13.htm">Leviticus 25:13</a>), and release from the bitter labour of cultivating the land (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-11.htm">Leviticus 25:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-12.htm">Leviticus 25:12</a>). This year of grace as proclaimed and began with the day of atonement of every seventh sabbatical year, to show that it was only with the full forgiveness of sins that the blessed liberty of the children of God could possibly commence. This grand year of grace was to return after seven times seven years; i.e., as is expressly stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>, every fiftieth year was to be sanctified as a year of jubilee. By this regulation of the time, the view held by R. Jehuda, and the chronologists and antiquarians who have followed him, that every seventh sabbatical year, i.e., the 49th year, was to be kept as the year of jubilee, is proved to be at variance with the text, and the fiftieth year is shown to be the year of rest, in which the sabbatical idea attained its fullest realization, and reached its earthly temporal close.</body></html>
