Observe the arguments here used against extortion: Fear thy God. Relieve the poor, that they may live with thee; for they may be serviceable to thee.

It is presumed that no Hebrew will become a slave except on the pressure of poverty, and this poverty his brethren are commanded to relieve; but foreseeing that either want of charity on the part of the rich or unthrift on the part of the poor would certainly bring about slavery, the legislator makes regulations so as to soften its character as far as possible. The literal translation of verse 35 is as follows: <span class="cmt_word">If thy brother becomes poor, and his hand faileth by thee, thou shalt lay hold of him; a stranger or a sojourner that he may live with thee.</span> The translation of the latter clause adopted by the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner</span>; <span class="accented">that he may live with thee</span>, makes the duty of giving charitable support and loans of money to apply to the case of the stranger and sojourner as well as of the Israelite. The other and more probable rendering confines its application to native Israelites. <span class="accented">If thy brother becomes poor, and his hand faileth, thou shalt support him as a stranger or a sojourner</span>, that is, treat him with the forbearance shown to resident foreigners, to whose state he had reduced himself by the loss of his land. The command in verse 36, <span class="cmt_word">Take thou no usury of him, or increase,</span> does not bear upon the general question of taking interest for money when lent to wealthy men or companies for business purposes. It simply forbids the taking of interest or increase of a brother Israelite who had become poor. The history of Rome shows how much cruelty and revolution such an injunction may have prevented. The words, <span class="accented">or increase</span>, added to <span class="accented">usury</span>, forbid the exaction of any greater quantity of food or clothing (a method of evading the law against usury) than that which had been lent. The injunction was transgressed in the time of Nehemiah, when "he rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother....  Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-7.htm">Nehemiah 5:7, 8</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Alienation and redemption of houses. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-29.htm">Leviticus 25:29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-30.htm">Leviticus 25:30</a>. On the sale of a dwelling-house in a wall-town (a town surrounded by a wall) there was to be redemption till the completion of the year of its purchase. &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, "days (i.e., a definite period) shall its redemption be;" that is to say, the right of redemption or repurchase should be retained. If it was not redeemed within the year, it remained to the buyer for ever for his descendants, and did not go out free in the year of jubilee. &#1511;&#1501; to arise for a possession, i.e., to become a fixed standing possession, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-17.htm">Genesis 23:17</a>. &#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; for &#1500;&#1493; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-21.htm">Leviticus 11:21</a> (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-8.htm">Exodus 21:8</a>). This law is founded upon the assumption, that the houses in unwalled towns are not so closely connected with the ownership of the land, as that the alienation of the houses would alter the portion originally assigned to each family for a possession. Having been built by men, they belonged to their owners in full possession, whether they had received them just as they were at the conquest of the land, or had erected them for themselves. This last point of view, however, was altogether a subordinate one; for in the case of "the houses of the villages" (i.e., farm-buildings and villages, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-23.htm">Joshua 13:23</a>, etc.), which had no walls round them, it was not taken into consideration at all.</body></html>
