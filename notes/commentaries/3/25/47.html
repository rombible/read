If he sold himself, through poverty, both his work and his usage must be such as were fitting for a son of Abraham. Masters are required to give to their servants that which is just and equal, Col 4:1. At the year of jubilee the servant should go out free, he and his children, and should return to his own family. This typified redemption from the service of sin and Satan, by the grace of God in Christ, whose truth makes us free, Joh 8:32. We cannot ransom our fellow-sinners, but we may point out Christ to them; while by his grace our lives may adorn his gospel, express our love, show our gratitude, and glorify his holy name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A sojourner or stranger - Rather, a foreigner who has settled among you.

In the event of his being reduced to this distress, he was to be treated not as a slave, but a hired servant whose engagement was temporary, and who might, through the friendly aid of a relative, be redeemed at any time before the Jubilee. The ransom money was determined on a most equitable principle. Taking account of the number of years from the proposal to redeem and the Jubilee, of the current wages of labor for that time, and multiplying the remaining years by that sum, the amount was to be paid to the master for his redemption. But if no such friendly interposition was made for a Hebrew slave, he continued in servitude till the year of Jubilee, when, as a matter of course, he regained his liberty, as well as his inheritance. Viewed in the various aspects in which it is presented in this chapter, the Jubilee was an admirable institution, and subservient in an eminent degree to uphold the interests of religion, social order, and freedom among the Israelites.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The stock, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">root</span>, i.e. one of the root or stock.

An uncircumcised one, as the Targums, a proselyte of the gate, who by living among and trading with the Israelites, might grow rich and wealthy in money, at least so as to be able to purchase an Hebrew servant, though not his lands, which he might not buy: <p>and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor; comes into low circumstances, and is reduced to great poverty, even extreme poverty; for only in such a case might he sell himself to an Israelite, and much less to a stranger, if this was not the case. Jarchi suggests, as in the phrase, "by thee", points at the cause or occasion of the sojourner or stranger becoming rich, his nearness unto, or cleaving to all Israelite; and so here the phrase, "by him", directs to the cause or occasion of the Israelite's becoming poor, his being near and cleaving to the sojourner or stranger: but they seem rather to be used, to show the reason of the poor Israelite falling into the hands of a rich sojourner; they being near neighbours to one another, and having a familiarity, the following bargain is struck between them: <p>and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner thee; the uncircumcised sojourner, as the Targum of Jonathan: <p>or to the stock of a stranger's family; or "root" (a), one that sprung from a family, originally proselytes; which some understand of one, who though he be descended from such a family, was now rooted among the people of God, and incorporated into the commonwealth of Israel; and yet such an one could not detain an Hebrew servant longer than the year of jubilee: but the Jewish writers generally interpret it of an idolater (b). <p>(a) "radici", Vatablus, Piscator.

In this case he is not set free at the end of six years, as he would be if his master were a countryman, but in other respects his treatment is to be like that of the man with an Israelite master. He may be redeemed by the value of his work down to the jubilee being paid by himself or his kinsman; he is to be set free when the jubilee comes at any rate; he is to be treated kindly while continuing in his master's service, and his countrymen are to see that no over-severity is used. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>If he borrowed money, they were not to demand interest; or if food, they were not to demand any addition, any larger quantity, when it was returned (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-24.htm">Exodus 22:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-20.htm">Deuteronomy 23:20-21</a>), from fear of God, who had redeemed Israel out of bondage, to give them the land of Canaan. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-37.htm">Leviticus 25:37</a> &#1493;&#1495;&#1497; is an abbreviation of &#1493;&#1495;&#1497;, which only occurs here. - From <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a> onwards there follow the laws relating to the bondage of the Israelite, who had been obliged to sell himself from poverty. <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-36.htm">Leviticus 25:36-46</a> relate to his service in bondage to an (other) Israelite. The man to whom he had sold himself as servant was not to have slave-labour performed by him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-14.htm">Exodus 1:14</a>), but to keep him as a day-labourer and sojourner, and let him serve with him till the year of jubilee. He was then to go out free with his children, and return to his family and the possession of his fathers (his patrimony). This regulation is a supplement to the laws relating to the rights of Israel (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2-6</a>), though without a contradiction arising, as Knobel maintains, between the different rules laid down. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21.htm">Exodus 21</a> nothing at all is determined respecting the treatment of an Israelitish servant; it is simply stated that in the seventh year of his service he was to recover his liberty. This limit is not mentioned here, because the chapter before us simply treats of the influence of the year of jubilee upon the bondage of the Israelites. On this point it is decided, that the year of jubilee was to bring freedom even to the Israelite who had been brought into slavery by his poverty, - of course only to the man who was still in slavery when it commenced and had not served seven full years, provided, that is to say, that he had not renounced his claim to be set free at the end of his seven years' service, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-5.htm">Exodus 21:5-6</a>. We have no right to expect this exception to be expressly mentioned here, because it did not interfere with the idea of the year of jubilee. For whoever voluntarily renounced the claim to be set free, whether because the year of jubilee was still so far off that he did not expect to live to see it, or because he had found a better lot with his master than he could secure for himself in a state of freedom, had thereby made a voluntary renunciation of the liberty which the year of jubilee might have brought to him (see Oehler's art. in Herzog's Cycl., where the different views on this subject are given).</body></html>
