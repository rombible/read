This will account for the horror which Naboth expressed to Ahab of selling his patrimony: “The Lord forbid it me that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to thee” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-3.htm" title="And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you.">1Kings 21:3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">then his nearest kinsman shall come and redeem. </span>If he has thus been compelled by pressure of poverty to sell part of his land, then it is the duty of the nearest relation, or, as the original literally denotes, “the redeemer that is nearest to him,” to redeem the property which his impoverished relative has been obliged to sell. The expression “redeemer” is applied in Hebrew to one who, by virtue of being the nearest of kin, had not only to redeem the patrimony of the family, but to marry the childless widow of his brother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-13.htm" title="Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform to you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as the LORD lives: lie down until the morning.">Ruth 3:13</a>), and avenge the blood of his relative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/35-19.htm" title="The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meets him, he shall slay him.">Numbers 35:19-28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/19-6.htm" title="Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.">Deuteronomy 19:6-12</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:23-34 If the land were not redeemed before the year of jubilee, it then returned to him that sold or mortgaged it. This was a figure of the free grace of God in Christ; by which, and not by any price or merit of our own, we are restored to the favour of God. Houses in walled cities were more the fruits of their own industry than land in the country, which was the direct gift of God's bounty; therefore if a man sold a house in a city, he might redeem it only within a year after the sale. This encouraged strangers and proselytes to come and settle among them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If thy brother be waxen poor - The Israelites never parted with their land except under the pressure of poverty.

The land shall not be sold for ever&#8212;or, "be quite cut off," as the Margin better renders it. The land was God's, and, in prosecution of an important design, He gave it to the people of His choice, dividing it among their tribes and families&#8212;who, however, held it of Him merely as tenants-at-will and had no right or power of disposing of it to strangers. In necessitous circumstances, individuals might effect a temporary sale. But they possessed the right of redeeming it, at any time, on payment of an adequate compensation to the present holder; and by the enactments of the Jubilee they recovered it free&#8212;so that the land was rendered inalienable.
