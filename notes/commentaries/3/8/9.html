Aaron and his sons were washed with water, to signify that they ought to purify themselves from all sinful dispositions, and ever after to keep themselves pure. Christ washes those from their sins in his own blood whom he makes kings and priests to our God, Re 1:5,6; and those that draw near to God must be washed in pure water, Heb 10:22. The anointing of Aaron was to typify the anointing of Christ with the Spirit, which was not given by measure to him.

Drunkenness is so odious a sin in itself, especially a minister, and most of all in the time of his administration of sacred things, that God saw fit to prevent all occasions of it. And hence the devil, who is God’s ape in his prescriptions for his worship, required this abstinence from his priests in their idolatrous service. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he put the mitre upon his head,....

It was made of fine linen; tradition describes it as 24 ft. long, so it was probably wound round the head like a turban.

He describes fully another mitre with a triple golden crown. This was probably an ornament added in later times. Alexander Balas sent a purple robe and a crown of gold to Jonathan which he wore at the Feast of Tabernacles b.c. 153 (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/10-20.htm" title="Wherefore now this day we ordain thee to be the high priest of thy nation, and to be called the king's friend; (and therewithal he sent him a purple robe and a crown of gold:) and require thee to take our part, and keep friendship with us.">1Ma 10:20</a>).

The Heb. word (<span class="ital">ẓîẓ</span>), translated ‘plate,’ implies something bright and glittering, and is elsewhere used of a flower. The plate was fastened by its lace of blue to the turban (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-37.htm" title="And you shall put it on a blue lace, that it may be on the turban; on the forefront of the turban it shall be.">Exodus 28:37</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-31.htm" title="And they tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high on the turban; as the LORD commanded Moses.">Exodus 39:31</a>) and would appear as an ornament or diadem in the headgear of the high priest.

Moses brought the persons to be consecrated, the official costume that had been made for them (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>), the anointing oil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>.), and the requisite sacrificial offerings (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1-3</a>), to the door of the tabernacle (i.e., into the court, near the altar of burnt-offering), and then gathered "the whole congregation" - that is to say, the nation in the persons of its elders-there also (see my Archeologie ii. p. 221). The definite article before the objects enumerated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-2.htm">Leviticus 8:2</a> may be explained on the ground that they had all been previously and more minutely described.
