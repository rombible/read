Aaron and his sons were washed with water, to signify that they ought to purify themselves from all sinful dispositions, and ever after to keep themselves pure. Christ washes those from their sins in his own blood whom he makes kings and priests to our God, Re 1:5,6; and those that draw near to God must be washed in pure water, Heb 10:22. The anointing of Aaron was to typify the anointing of Christ with the Spirit, which was not given by measure to him. All believers have received the anointing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gather ... - Rather, gather all the assembly together toward the entrance of the tent of meeting. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-13.htm">Leviticus 4:13</a>. The whole body of the people were summoned on this occasion, and the elders probably occupied the first places. The elders are especially called together in an unequivocal manner to receive directions to provide the first sacrifices for the nation to be offered by the newly consecrated priests <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-1.htm">Leviticus 9:1</a>, and the body of the people afterward assemble as they do here <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-5.htm">Leviticus 9:5</a>. The spot designated was the portion of the court in front of the tabernacle (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a> note). Toward this space the people were commanded to assemble to witness the great national ceremony of the consecration of the priesthood, the solemn setting apart of one of their families, the members of which were henceforth to stand as mediators between them and Yahweh in carrying out the precepts of the ceremonial law. Those who could do so, may have come into the court, and a great number of others may have occupied the heights which overlooked the enclosure of the court. As the series of ceremonies was repeated every day during a week <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-33.htm">Leviticus 8:33</a>, it is natural to suppose that some of the people attended on one day and some on another. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-5. gather thou all the congregation together, &c.&#8212;It was manifestly expedient for the Israelitish people to be satisfied that Aaron's appointment to the high dignity of the priesthood was not a personal intrusion, nor a family arrangement between him and Moses; and nothing, therefore, could be a more prudent or necessary measure, for impressing a profound conviction of the divine origin and authority of the priestly institution, than to summon a general assembly of the people, and in their presence perform the solemn ceremonies of inauguration, which had been prescribed by divine authority.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Moses did as the Lord commanded him,....

"This (the wave-breast and heave-leg) is the share of Aaron and his sons from the firings of Jehovah in the day (i.e., which Jehovah assigned to them in the day) when He caused them to draw near to become priests to Jehovah," i.e., according to the explanation in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-36.htm">Leviticus 7:36</a>, "in the day of their anointing." The word &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-35.htm">Leviticus 7:35</a>, like &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8</a>, signifies not "anointing," but share, portio, literally a measuring off, as in Aramaean and Arabic, from &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495; to stroke the hand over anything, to measure, or measure off.<p>The fulness with which every point in the sacrificial meal is laid down, helps to confirm the significance of the peace-offerings, as already implied in the name &#1494;&#1489;&#1495; sacrificial slaughtering, slain-offering, viz., as indicating that they were intended for, and culminated in a liturgical meal. By placing his hand upon the head of the animal, which had been brought to the altar of Jehovah for the purpose, the offerer signified that with this gift, which served to nourish and strengthen his own life, he gave up the substance of his life to the Lord, that he might thereby be strengthened both body and soul for a holy walk and conversation. To this end he slaughtered the victim and had the blood sprinkled by the priest against the altar, and the fat portions burned upon it, that in these altar-gifts his soul and his inner man might be grounded afresh in the gracious fellowship of the Lord. He then handed over the breast-piece by the process of waving, also the right leg, and a sacrificial cake of each kind, as a heave-offering from the whole to the Lord, who transferred these portions to the priests as His servants, that they might take part as His representatives in the sacrificial meal. In consequence of this participation of the priests, the feast, which the offerer of the sacrifice prepared for himself and his family from the rest of the flesh, became a holy covenant meal, a meal of love and joy, which represented domestic fellowship with the Lord, and thus shadowed forth, on the one hand, rejoicing before the Lord (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-12.htm">Deuteronomy 12:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-18.htm">Deuteronomy 12:18</a>), and on the other, the blessedness of eating and drinking in the kingdom of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-15.htm">Luke 13:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>). Through the fact that one portion was given up to the Lord, the earthly food was sanctified as a symbol of the true spiritual food, with which the Lord satisfies and refreshes the citizens of His kingdom. This religious aspect of the sacrificial meal will explain the instructions given, viz., that not only the flesh itself, but those who took part in the meal, were all to be clean, and that whatever remained of the flesh was to be burned, on the second or third day respectively, that it might not pass into a state of decomposition. The burning took place a day earlier in the case of the praise-offering than in that of the vow and freewill-offerings, of which the offerer was allowed a longer enjoyment, because they were the products of his own spontaneity, which covered any defect that might attach to the gift itself. </body></html>
