Aaron and his sons were washed with water, to signify that they ought to purify themselves from all sinful dispositions, and ever after to keep themselves pure. Christ washes those from their sins in his own blood whom he makes kings and priests to our God, Re 1:5,6; and those that draw near to God must be washed in pure water, Heb 10:22. The anointing of Aaron was to typify the anointing of Christ with the Spirit, which was not given by measure to him. All believers have received the anointing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Aaron's sons - The common priests. Nothing is said here, or in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/29-7.htm">Exodus 29:7-9</a>, of the anointing of the common priests, though it is expressly commanded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-41.htm">Exodus 28:41</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-15.htm">Exodus 40:15</a>, and is evidently implied as a fact in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-36.htm">Leviticus 7:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-7.htm">Leviticus 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-3.htm">Numbers 3:3</a>.

Aaron’s sons are clothed with tunics, sashes, and caps. The tunics and sashes are not described; whether they were less elaborate than those of the high priest does not appear, but is probable. The caps (<span class="ital">headtires</span> R.V., <span class="ital">bonnets</span> A.V.) were of fine linen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-28.htm" title="And a turban of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,">Exodus 39:28</a>), and the Heb. word is used only of the head-gear of the ordinary priests.

But there is no statement here of their being anointed, although their anointing is ordered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-41.htm">Exodus 28:41</a>, and still more imperatively in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-15.htm">Exodus 40:15</a>. They are spoken of as "anointed" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-36.htm">Leviticus 7:36</a>, and as having "the anointing oil of the Lord upon them" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-7.htm">Leviticus 10:7</a>. On the other hand, the high priest is specially designated as "the priest that is anointed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>). It is probable that the personal anointing of the ordinary priests was confined to their being sprinkled with oil, as described below in verse 30; but that they were regarded as virtually anointed in Aaron's anointing. The Levites had no special dress until they obtained permission from Herod Agrippa I[. to wear the priestly robes (Joseph., 'Ant.,' 20:09, 6). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then followed the clothing of Aaron.

This investiture, regarded as the putting on of an important official dress, was a symbol of his endowment with the character required for the discharge of the duties of his office, the official costume being the outward sign of installation in the office which he was to fill.</body></html>
