The blood of this was, in part, put on the priests, their <span class="ital">ears, thumbs, </span>and <span class="ital">toes; </span>and, in part, sprinkled on the altar, signifying that they were (so to speak) married to the altar, and must all their days attend upon it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:14-36 In these types we see our great High Priest, even Christ Jesus, solemnly appointed, anointed, and invested with his sacred office, by his own blood, and the influences of his Holy Spirit. He sanctifies the ordinances of religion, to the benefit of his people and the honour of God the Father; who for his sake accepts our worship, though it is polluted with sin. We may also rejoice, that he is a merciful and faithful High Priest, full of compassion to the feeble-minded and tempest-tossed soul. All true Christians are consecrated to be spiritual priests. We should seriously ask ourselves, whether in our daily walk we study to maintain this character? and abound in spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Christ? If so, still there is no cause for boasting. Let us not despise our fellow-sinners; but remembering what we have done, and how we are saved, let us seek and pray for their salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The ram of consecration - The sacrifice of this ram was by far the most unique part of the whole ceremony.

The blood of the ram is applied to the ear, hand, and foot of Aaron and his sons. The ear attentive to the commands of God, the hand ready to do His will, the foot prepared to walk in His ways are thus signified. The blood is also thrown (as enjoined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-2.htm" title="And he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood on the altar round about.">Leviticus 3:2</a>) against the altar round about.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/8-23.htm" title="And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it on the tip of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot....">Leviticus 8:23-24</a></span> the blood is put first on Aaron and afterwards on his sons; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-20.htm" title="Then shall you kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it on the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and on the tip of the right ear of his sons, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood on the altar round about.">Exodus 29:20</a>, where a separate bringing near of the sons is not enjoined.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-29.</span> - The ram offered as a peace offering is called <span class="cmt_word">the ram of consecration</span>, or literally, <span class="accented">of filling</span>, because one of the means by which the consecration was effected and exhibited was the filling the hands of those presented for consecration with the portion of the sacrifice destined for the altar, which they <span class="cmt_word">waved for a wave offering before the Lord</span>, previous to its consumption by the fire. This portion consisted of the internal fat and tail, which was usually burnt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31</a>), and the heave offering of <span class="cmt_word">the right shoulder</span>, or hind leg, which generally went to the officiating priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-32.htm">Leviticus 7:32</a>), and one of each of the unleavened cakes. After this special ceremony of waving, peculiar to the rite of consecration, the usual wave offering (the breast) was waved by Moses and consumed by himself. Ordinarily it was for the priests in general (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31</a>). The blood was poured on the side of the altar, as was done in all peace offerings, but in addition, on the present occasion, it was <span class="cmt_word">put upon the tip of</span> the <span class="cmt_word">right ear</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">upon the thumb of</span> the <span class="cmt_word">right hand</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">upon the great toe of</span> the <span class="cmt_word">right foot</span> of the priests who were being consecrated, symbolizing that their senses and active powers were being devoted to God's service. The same ceremony is to be used in the restoration of the leper (see chapter Leviticus 14:14). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The sacrificial ceremony with which the consecration was concluded, consisted of a threefold sacrifice, the materials for which were not supplied by the persons about to be installed, but were no doubt provided by Moses at the expense of the congregation, for which the priesthood was instituted. Moses officiated as the mediator of the covenant, through whose service Aaron and his sons were to be consecrated as priests of Jehovah, and performed every part of the sacrificial rite-the slaughtering, sprinkling of the blood, and burning of the altar gifts, - just as the priests afterwards did at the public daily and festal sacrifices, the persons to be consecrated simply laying their hands upon the sacrificial animals, to set them apart as their representatives.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14-17</a><p>The first sacrifice was a sin-offering, for which a young ox was taken (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1</a>), as in the case of the sin-offerings for the high priest and the whole congregation (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-14.htm">Leviticus 4:14</a>): the highest kind of sacrificial animal, which corresponded to the position to be occupied by the priests in the Israelitish kingdom of God, as the &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769; of the covenant nation. Moses put some of the blood with his finger upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering, and poured the rest at the foot of the altar. The far portions (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-3.htm">Leviticus 3:3-4</a>) he burned upon the altar; but the flesh of the ox, as well as the hide and dung, he burned outside the camp. According to the general rule of the sin-offerings, whose flesh was burnt outside the camp, the blood was brought into the sanctuary itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-23.htm">Leviticus 6:23</a>); but here it was only put upon the altar of burnt-offering to make this sin-offering a consecration-sacrifice. Moses was to take the blood to "purify (&#1497;&#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;) and sanctify the altar, to expiate it." As the altar had been sanctified immediately before by the anointing with holy oil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-11.htm">Leviticus 8:11</a>), the object of the cleansing or sanctification of it through the blood of the sacrifice cannot have been to purify it a second time from uncleanness, that still adhered to it, or was inherent in it; but just as the purification or expiation of the vessels or worship generally applied only to the sins of the nation, by which these vessels had been defiled (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-16.htm">Leviticus 16:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-19.htm">Leviticus 16:19</a>), so here the purification of the altar with the blood of the sin-offering, upon which the priests had laid their hands, had reference simply to pollutions, with which the priests defiled the altar when officiating at it, through the uncleanness of their sinful nature. As the priests could not be installed in the functions of the priesthood, notwithstanding the holiness communicated to them through the anointing, without a sin-offering to awaken the consciousness in both themselves and the nation that the sinfulness which lay at the root of human nature was not removed by the anointing, but only covered in the presence of the holy God, and that sin still clung to man, and polluted all his doings and designs; so that altar, upon which they were henceforth to offer sacrifices, still required to be purified through the blood of the bullock, that had been slaughtered as a sin-offering for the expiation of their sins, to sanctify it for the service of the priests, i.e., to cover up the sins by which they would defile it when performing their service. For this sanctification the blood of the sin-offering, that had been slaughtered for them, was taken, to indicate the fellowship which was henceforth to exist between them and the altar, and to impress upon them the fact, that the blood, by which they were purified, was also to serve as the means of purifying the altar from the sins attaching to their service. Although none of the blood of this sin-offering was carried into the holy place, because only the anointed priests were to be thereby inducted into the fellowship of the altar, the flesh of the animal could only be burnt outside the camp, because the sacrifice served to purify the priesthood (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-11.htm">Leviticus 4:11-12</a>). For the rest, the remarks made on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-4.htm">Leviticus 4:4</a> are also applicable to the symbolical meaning of this sacrifice.</body></html>
