This verse, therefore, introduces the second degree of punishments, which ends with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-20.htm" title="And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.">Leviticus 26:20</a>.<p><span class= "bld">I will punish you seven times more.</span>—That is, indefinitely or unceasingly; many more times. Seven being a complete number is often used to denote thoroughness (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-6.htm" title="And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the veil of the sanctuary.">Leviticus 4:6</a>), a large or indefinite number. Hence the declaration “He shall deliver thee in six troubles; yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-19.htm" title="He shall deliver you in six troubles: yes, in seven there shall no evil touch you.">Job 5:19</a>), and “if he trespass against thee seven times in <span class= "bld">a </span>day” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-4.htm" title="And if he trespass against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to you, saying, I repent; you shall forgive him.">Luke 17:4</a>), that is, an indefinite number of times. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-164.htm" title="Seven times a day do I praise you because of your righteous judgments.">Psalm 119:164</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-16.htm" title="For a just man falls seven times, and rises up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.">Proverbs 24:16</a>, &c.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:14-39 After God has set the blessing before them which would make them a happy people if they would be obedient, he here sets the curse before them, the evils which would make them miserable, if they were disobedient. Two things would bring ruin. 1. A contempt of God's commandments. They that reject the precept, will come at last to renounce the covenant. 2. A contempt of his corrections. If they will not learn obedience by the things they suffer, God himself would be against them; and this is the root and cause of all their misery. And also, The whole creation would be at war with them. All God's sore judgments would be sent against them. The threatenings here are very particular, they were prophecies, and He that foresaw all their rebellions, knew they would prove so. TEMPORAL judgments are threatened. Those who will not be parted from their sins by the commands of God, shall be parted from them by judgments. Those wedded to their lusts, will have enough of them. SPIRITUAL judgments are threatened, which should seize the mind. They should find no acceptance with God. A guilty conscience would be their continual terror. It is righteous with God to leave those to despair of pardon, who presume to sin; and it is owing to free grace, if we are not left to pine away in the iniquity we were born in, and have lived in.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For all this - i. e. for all the afflictions in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16-17</a>.<p>Seven times - The sabbatical number is here proverbially used to remind the people of the covenant.
