But national prosperity was the effect of national obedience, and national judgments were brought on by national wickedness. Israel was under a peculiar covenant. National wickedness will end in the ruin of any people, especially where the word of God and the light of the gospel are enjoyed. Sooner or later, sin will be the ruin, as well as the reproach, of every people. Oh that, being humbled for our sins, we might avert the rising storm before it bursts upon us! God grant that we may, in this our day, consider the things which belong to our eternal peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Uncircumcised hearts - The outward sign of the covenant might be preserved, but the answering grace in the heart would be wanting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-10.htm">Jeremiah 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>).<p>Accept of the punishment of their iniquity - literally, enjoy their iniquity. The word here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-43.htm">Leviticus 26:43</a> rendered "accept" in this phrase, is the same as is rendered "enjoy" in the expression "the land shall enjoy her sabbaths" <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-34.htm">Leviticus 26:34</a>. The antithesis in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-43.htm">Leviticus 26:43</a> is this: The land shall enjoy her sabbaths - and they shall enjoy the punishment of their iniquity. The meaning is, that the land being desolate shall have the blessing of rest, and they having repented shall have the blessing of chastisement. The feelings of a devout captive Israelite are beautifully expressed in Tobit 13:1-18. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40-45.
