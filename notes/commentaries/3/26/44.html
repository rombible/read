But national prosperity was the effect of national obedience, and national judgments were brought on by national wickedness. Israel was under a peculiar covenant. National wickedness will end in the ruin of any people, especially where the word of God and the light of the gospel are enjoyed. Sooner or later, sin will be the ruin, as well as the reproach, of every people. Oh that, being humbled for our sins, we might avert the rising storm before it bursts upon us! God grant that we may, in this our day, consider the things which belong to our eternal peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Uncircumcised hearts - The outward sign of the covenant might be preserved, but the answering grace in the heart would be wanting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-10.htm">Jeremiah 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>).<p>Accept of the punishment of their iniquity - literally, enjoy their iniquity. The word here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-43.htm">Leviticus 26:43</a> rendered "accept" in this phrase, is the same as is rendered "enjoy" in the expression "the land shall enjoy her sabbaths" <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-34.htm">Leviticus 26:34</a>. The antithesis in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-43.htm">Leviticus 26:43</a> is this: The land shall enjoy her sabbaths - and they shall enjoy the punishment of their iniquity. The meaning is, that the land being desolate shall have the blessing of rest, and they having repented shall have the blessing of chastisement. The feelings of a devout captive Israelite are beautifully expressed in Tobit 13:1-18. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40-45.

I will have on them, in or through my Word, as the Targum of Jonathan; notwithstanding their many and great sins and transgressions, and the sad and miserable condition they were brought into by them, the Lord would have mercy on them and be gracious to them, through Christ and for his sake, and convert and save them, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a>; the Jews, as Fagius tells us, wonderfully delight themselves with this passage, and read it with the greatest joy and pleasure, and with an elevated voice; concluding from hence that they shall certainly return to their own land; and because the first word in this verse is in sound the same as the Germans use for an "ape", they call this paragraph "the golden ape", and say, when this shall be fulfilled the golden age will take place with them: a very learned man (f) has wrote a dissertation upon it: when <p>they shall be in the land of their enemies; of the Romans and other nations, among whom they have been disposed ever since the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus: <p>I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly; for though they have been cast away by the Lord out of their land, and from being his people, and enjoying either the civil or religious privileges they formerly did; and though they have been cast off with abhorrence, and had in great detestation by him, for their sin of rejecting the Messiah, as appears by the punishment inflicted on them; yet not so as to make an utter end of them as a body of people, for, notwithstanding their dispersion everywhere, and their long captivity, they remain a distinct people from all others, which seems to forebode something favourable to them: <p>and to break my covenant with them; which he will not do, even his promise of the future call and conversion of them, and of their return to their own land: <p>for I am the Lord their God; their covenant God, and a covenant keeping God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-27.htm">Romans 11:27</a>. <p>(f) Carpzovius de aurea Judaeorum Simia, in Thesaur.
