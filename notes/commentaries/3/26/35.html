Two things would bring ruin. 1. A contempt of God's commandments. They that reject the precept, will come at last to renounce the covenant. 2. A contempt of his corrections. If they will not learn obedience by the things they suffer, God himself would be against them; and this is the root and cause of all their misery. And also, The whole creation would be at war with them. All God's sore judgments would be sent against them. The threatenings here are very particular, they were prophecies, and He that foresaw all their rebellions, knew they would prove so. TEMPORAL judgments are threatened. Those who will not be parted from their sins by the commands of God, shall be parted from them by judgments. Those wedded to their lusts, will have enough of them. SPIRITUAL judgments are threatened, which should seize the mind. They should find no acceptance with God. A guilty conscience would be their continual terror. It is righteous with God to leave those to despair of pardon, who presume to sin; and it is owing to free grace, if we are not left to pine away in the iniquity we were born in, and have lived in.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>More literally: All the days of its desolation shall it rest that time which it rested not in your Sabbaths while ye dwelt upon it.

Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, &c.&#8212;A long arrear of sabbatic years had accumulated through the avarice and apostasy of the Israelites, who had deprived their land of its appointed season of rest. The number of those sabbatic years seems to have been seventy, as determined by the duration of the captivity. This early prediction is very remarkable, considering that the usual policy of the Assyrian conquerors was to send colonies to cultivate and inhabit their newly acquired provinces.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest,....

Eating the flesh of their own children is mentioned first, as indicating the extremity of the misery and wretchedness in which the people would perish; and after this, the judgment, by which the nation would be brought to this extremity, is more minutely described in its four principal features: viz., (1) the destruction of all idolatrous abominations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>); (2) the overthrow of the towns and sanctuaries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31</a>); (3) the devastation of the land, to the amazement of the enemies who dwelt therein (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-32.htm">Leviticus 26:32</a>); and (4) the dispersion of the people among the heathen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>). The "high places" are altars erected upon heights and mountains in the land, upon which sacrifices were offered both to Jehovah in an unlawful way and also to heathen deities. &#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, sun-pillars, are idols of the Canaanitish nature-worship, either simple pillars dedicated to Baal, or idolatrous statues of the sun-god (cf. Movers Phnizier i. pp. 343ff.). "And I give your carcases upon the carcases of your idols." &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, lit., clods, from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500; to roll, a contemptuous expression for idols. With the idols the idolaters also were to perish, and defile with their corpses the images, which had also become corpses as it were, through their overthrow and destruction. For the further execution of this threat, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-4.htm">Ezekiel 6:4</a>. This will be your lot, for "My soul rejects you." By virtue of the inward character of His holy nature, Jehovah must abhor and reject the sinner. </body></html>
