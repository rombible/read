By separating them from their proper position, and making them begin a new chapter, both the logical sequence and the import of these two verses are greatly obscured. As Lev 26:47-55 legislated for cases where Israelites are driven by extreme poverty to sell themselves to a heathen, and when they may be compelled to continue in this service to the year of jubile, and thus be obliged to witness idolatrous practices, the Lawgiver solemnly repeats the two fundamental precepts of Judaism, which they might be in danger of neglecting, viz., to abstain from idol-worship and to keep the Sabbath, which are two essential commandments of the Decalogue. The same two commandments, but in reverse order, are also joined together in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/19-3.htm" title="You shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 19:3-4</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Idols.</span>—For this expression see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-4.htm" title="Turn you not to idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 19:4</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">nor shall ye rear you up</span> <span class= "ital">a graven image or pillar. </span>Graven image is not only a plastic image of a heathen deity, but a visible or sensuous representation of the God of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/20-19.htm" title="And they said to Moses, Speak you with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.">Exodus 20:19-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/4-15.htm" title="Take you therefore good heed to yourselves; for you saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spoke to you in Horeb out of the middle of the fire:">Deuteronomy 4:15-16</a>).<p><span class= "bld">A standing image.</span>—This expression, which only occurs once more in the text of the Authorised Version (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-13.htm" title="Your graven images also will I cut off, and your standing images out of the middle of you; and you shall no more worship the work of your hands.">Micah 5:13</a>), and four times in the Margin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm" title="For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.">1Kings 14:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-13.htm" title="He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.">Jeremiah 43:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-1.htm" title="Israel is an empty vine, he brings forth fruit to himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he has increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.">Hosea 10:1</a>), is the rendering of a Hebrew word (<span class= "ital">matzebah</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which is usually and more correctly translated “pillar” or “statue” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-18.htm" title="And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.">Genesis 28:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-22.htm" title="And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that you shall give me I will surely give the tenth to you.">Genesis 28:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-13.htm" title="I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar, and where you vowed a vow to me: now arise, get you out from this land, and return to the land of your kindred.">Genesis 31:13</a>, &c.). This was a plain and rude stone without any image engraved on it, and was not unfrequently erected to God himself. but in after-time more especially as a memorial to false deities. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-18.htm" title="And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.">Genesis 28:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-22.htm" title="And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that you shall give me I will surely give the tenth to you.">Genesis 28:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-13.htm" title="I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar, and where you vowed a vow to me: now arise, get you out from this land, and return to the land of your kindred.">Genesis 31:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-14.htm" title="And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.">Genesis 35:14</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-24.htm" title="You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but you shall utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.">Exodus 23:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-13.htm" title="But you shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:">Exodus 34:13</a>, &c.)<p><span class= "bld">Neither shall ye set up any image of stone.</span>—The authorities during the second Temple interpreted the words here rendered “images of stone” to denote <span class= "ital">beholding, </span>or <span class= "ital">worshipping stones</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>stones set in the ground in places of worship upon which the worshippers prostrated themselves to perform their devotions. The stone was therefore a kind of signal, calling the attention of the worshipper to itself, so that he may fall down upon it. With such stones, these authorities assure us, the Temple was paved, since they were perfectly lawful in the sanctuary, but must not be used in worship out of the Temple, or rather, out of the land, as these authorities understood the words “in your land” here to denote. Hence the Chaldee Version paraphrases it, “and a painted stone ye shall not place in your land to prostrate yourselves upon it, but a pavement adorned with figures and pictures ye may put in the floor of your sanctuary, but not to bow down upon it,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in an idolatrous manner. Hence, too, the ancient canon, “in your own land” (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in all other lands) “ye must not prostrate yourselves upon stones, but ye may prostrate yourselves upon the stones in the sanctuary.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/26-1.htm" title="You shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither raise you up a standing image, neither shall you set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down to it: for I am the LORD your God....">Leviticus 26:1-2</a></span>. The substance of their religious laws are here recapitulated in two chief articles, on which all the rest very much depended; and God, by Moses, inculcates upon them, 1st, A careful abhorrence of all <span class="ital">idolatrous </span>worship, especially that of image-worship of every kind, which had often been forbidden before; and, 2d, An exact celebration of the sabbath, and all other religious festivals; and a punctual regard to God’s worship, according to the stated ordinances to be observed in the tabernacle service; and all this as a means to preserve them from the corruptions and superstitions of the rest of the world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Ye shall make no idols — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">אלילם</span> <span class="ital">elilim, </span>things of naught; the same word which occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-4.htm" title="Turn you not to idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 19:4</a>. <span class="ital">Nor graven image — </span><span class="greekheb">פסל</span>, <span class="ital">phesel; </span>which signifies any image hewn out of wood or stone.

While Israel maintained a national regard to God's worship, sabbaths, and sanctuary, and did not turn aside to idolatry, the Lord engaged to continue to them temporal mercies and religious advantages. These great and precious promises, though they relate chiefly to the life which now is, were typical of the spiritual blessings made sure by the covenant of grace to all believers, through Christ. 1. Plenty and abundance of the fruits of the earth. Every good and perfect gift must be expected from above, from the Father of lights. 2. Peace under the Divine protection. Those dwell in safety, that dwell in God. 3. Victory and success in their wars. It is all one with the Lord to save by many or by few. 4. The increase of their people. The gospel church shall be fruitful. 5. The favour of God, which is the fountain of all Good. 6. Tokens of his presence in and by his ordinances. The way to have God's ordinances fixed among us, is to cleave closely to them. 7. The grace of the covenant. All covenant blessings are summed up in the covenant relation, I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; and they are all grounded upon their redemption. Having purchased them, God would own them, and never cast them off till they cast him off.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Idols - literally, "things of nought."

Some of the Jewish writers, as Jarchi and Aben Ezra, think this law against idolatry is mentioned on account of the Israelite sold to a stranger, spoken of in the latter part of the preceding chapter, lest he should be drawn into idolatry; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-48.htm">Leviticus 25:48</a>; but this is rather mentioned as being a principal law, respecting the honour and glory of God, and the foundation of all religion and godliness, and the breach of it a capital crime, and which led on to other sins, and exposed to the displeasure and resentment of God, and brought on all the calamities after mentioned in this chapter. "Idols" here signify "things of nought", as an idol is nothing in the world, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>; and a "graven image", any likeness of man or beast cut out of wood, or stone; and may include any molten image of gold, silver, or brass, and then engraven with a tool, as the golden calf was, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>, <p>neither rear you up a standing image; or pillar (g); an heap of rude stones, set up pillar, not bearing the likeness of any creature; otherwise graven and molten images were standing ones, but these were statues without any figure; such as the Arabians used to worship; the god Mars, worshipped in Arabia Petraea, was no other than a black stone four square, unformed, four feet high, and two broad, and was placed on a basis of gold (h): <p>neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto; any "figured stone", as the Targum and Aben Ezra interpret it, which had figures and representations of creatures cut in it, in order to bow down unto and worship: the word has the signification of covering, as they cover a floor with a pavement of stones: <p>for I am the Lord your God; who is the alone object of religious worship and adoration. <p>(g) Sept.
