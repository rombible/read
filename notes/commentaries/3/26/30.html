Similar is the picture given by Ezekiel, “Your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken, and I will cast down your slain men before your idols, and I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones round about your altars” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/6-4.htm" title="And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.">Ezekiel 6:4-5</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-30.htm" title="And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcasses on the carcasses of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.">Leviticus 26:30</a></span>. <span class="ital">Your high places — </span>In which you will sacrifice after the manner of the heathen.

But the word <span class="ital">carcasses </span>may signify the <span class="ital">ruins </span>of their idols in general; the broken pieces of their images. Or this word may be made use of to signify that their idols, how specious soever, or glorious in their eyes, were in truth but lifeless and contemptible carcasses, and should be so far from helping them, that they should be thrown down and broken with them, and both should lie together in a forlorn and loathsome state. See a similar threatening, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/6-4.htm" title="And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols....">Ezekiel 6:4-13</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/8-1.htm" title="At that time, said the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves:...">Jeremiah 8:1-2</a>.

Two things would bring ruin. 1. A contempt of God's commandments. They that reject the precept, will come at last to renounce the covenant. 2. A contempt of his corrections. If they will not learn obedience by the things they suffer, God himself would be against them; and this is the root and cause of all their misery. And also, The whole creation would be at war with them. All God's sore judgments would be sent against them. The threatenings here are very particular, they were prophecies, and He that foresaw all their rebellions, knew they would prove so. TEMPORAL judgments are threatened. Those who will not be parted from their sins by the commands of God, shall be parted from them by judgments. Those wedded to their lusts, will have enough of them. SPIRITUAL judgments are threatened, which should seize the mind. They should find no acceptance with God. A guilty conscience would be their continual terror. It is righteous with God to leave those to despair of pardon, who presume to sin; and it is owing to free grace, if we are not left to pine away in the iniquity we were born in, and have lived in.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>High places - There is no doubt that the word here denotes elevated spots dedicated to false worship (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>), and especially, it would seem, to that of Baal <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-41.htm">Numbers 22:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>. Such spots were, however, employed and approved for the worship of Yahweh, not only before the building of the temple, but afterward (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25-26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-16.htm">Judges 13:16-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-10.htm">1 Samuel 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-5.htm">1 Samuel 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-2.htm">1 Kings 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-30.htm">1 Kings 18:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-3.htm">2 Kings 12:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>, etc.). The three altars built by Abraham at Shechem, between Bethel and Ai, and at Mamre, appear to have been on heights, and so was the temple.<p>The high places in the holy land may thus have been divided into those dedicated to the worship of Yahweh, and those which had been dedicated to idols. And it would seem as if there was a constant struggle going on. The high places polluted by idol worship were of course to be wholly condemned. They were probably resorted to only to gratify a degraded superstition. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2-5</a>. The others might have been innocently used for prayer and religious teaching. But the temptation appears to have been too great for the temper of the people. They offered sacrifice and burnt incense on them; and hence, thorough reformers of the national religion, such as Hezekiah and Josiah, removed the high places altogether <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a>.<p>Your images - The original word is rendered in the margin of our Bible sun images (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-5.htm">2 Chronicles 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-8.htm">Isaiah 17:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-4.htm">Ezekiel 6:4</a>, etc.).
