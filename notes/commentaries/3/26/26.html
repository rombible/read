This metaphor also occurs in other parts of Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm" title="For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, does take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water.">Isaiah 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-16.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:">Ezekiel 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-16.htm" title="When I shall send on them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine on you, and will break your staff of bread:">Ezekiel 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-13.htm" title="Son of man, when the land sins against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out my hand on it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine on it, and will cut off man and beast from it:">Ezekiel 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-16.htm" title="Moreover he called for a famine on the land: he broke the whole staff of bread.">Psalm 105:16</a>). This, in addition to the pestilence in the cities, which will drive them to deliver themselves up to the enemy, or rather the cause of this pestilence will be the famine which will rage in the town whither they fled for protection.<p><span class= "bld">Ten women shall bake your bread in one oven.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">then ten women, </span>&c., that is, so great will be the famine when God cuts off the supply, that one ordinary oven will suffice to bake the bread of ten families, who are represented by their ten women, whilst in ordinary times one oven was only sufficient for one family.<p><span class= "bld">And they shall deliver you your bread again by weight.</span>—When it is brought from the bake-house each one will not be allowed to eat as much as he requires, but will have his stinted allowance most carefully served out to him by weight. Parallel to this picture of misery is the appalling scene described by Ezekiel, “I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care, and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment; that they may want bread and water, and be astonished one with another, and consume away for their iniquity” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/4-16.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:">Ezekiel 4:16-17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-26.htm" title="And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and you shall eat, and not be satisfied.">Leviticus 26:26</a></span>. <span class="ital">When I have broken the staff of your bread — </span>By sending a famine, or scarcity of bread, which is the staff and support of man’s present life. <span class="ital">Ten women — </span>That is, ten or many families, for the women took care for the bread and food of all the family. <span class="ital">By weight — </span>This is a sign and consequence both of a famine, and of the baking of the bread of several families together in one oven, wherein each family took care to weigh their bread, and to receive the same proportion which they put in.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:14-39 After God has set the blessing before them which would make them a happy people if they would be obedient, he here sets the curse before them, the evils which would make them miserable, if they were disobedient. Two things would bring ruin. 1. A contempt of God's commandments. They that reject the precept, will come at last to renounce the covenant. 2. A contempt of his corrections. If they will not learn obedience by the things they suffer, God himself would be against them; and this is the root and cause of all their misery. And also, The whole creation would be at war with them. All God's sore judgments would be sent against them. The threatenings here are very particular, they were prophecies, and He that foresaw all their rebellions, knew they would prove so. TEMPORAL judgments are threatened. Those who will not be parted from their sins by the commands of God, shall be parted from them by judgments. Those wedded to their lusts, will have enough of them. SPIRITUAL judgments are threatened, which should seize the mind. They should find no acceptance with God. A guilty conscience would be their continual terror. It is righteous with God to leave those to despair of pardon, who presume to sin; and it is owing to free grace, if we are not left to pine away in the iniquity we were born in, and have lived in.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Omit "and." "To break the staff of bread," was a proverbial expression for cutting off the supply of bread, the staff of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-16.htm">Psalm 105:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-16.htm">Ezekiel 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-13.htm">Ezekiel 14:13</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>).

Brought a famine, at least a scarcity of provisions upon them, deprived them of bread, the staff of life, by which it is supported; or however made it very scarce among them, so that they had hardly a sufficiency to sustain nature, and perhaps the blessing of nourishment withheld from that; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>, <p>ten women shall bake your bread in one oven; for want of wood, according to Jarchi; or rather through scarcity of bread corn, they should have so little to bake every week, that one oven would be sufficient for ten families, which in a time of plenty each made use of one for themselves; and so Aben Ezra says, it was a custom in Israel for every family to bake in an oven by themselves, which they ate the whole week. Ten is a certain number for an uncertain, and denotes many, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-23.htm">Zechariah 8:23</a>.

Moreover, instead of the bread being brought home from the oven in such an abundant quantity that there is no need of weighing it, as there is obviously enough for all comers, it will then be needful to weigh it with the utmost precision, that the scanty supply may be measured out carefully to each, lest any should get more than their share.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>First stage of the aggravated judgments. - If they did not hearken &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1491;, "up to these" (the punishments named in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>), that is to say, if they persisted in their disobedience even when the judgments reached to this height, God would add a sevenfold chastisement on account of their sins, would punish them seven times more severely, and break down their strong pride by fearful drought. Seven, as the number of perfection in the works of God, denotes the strengthening of the chastisement, even to the height of its full measure (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-16.htm">Proverbs 24:16</a>). &#1506;&#1494; &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, lit., the eminence or pride of strength, includes everything upon which a nation rests its might; then the pride and haughtiness which rely upon earthly might and its auxiliaries (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-6.htm">Ezekiel 30:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-18.htm">Ezekiel 30:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-28.htm">Ezekiel 33:28</a>); here it signifies the pride of a nation, puffed up by the fruitfulness and rich produce of its land.
