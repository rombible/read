Thus the sword which God promised should not go through their land (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-6.htm" title="And I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.">Leviticus 26:6</a>) if they walk according to the Divine commandments, will now be wielded by Himself to bring about their utter dispersion from the land. A similar appalling scene is described by Jeremiah: “I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers hare known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-16.htm" title="I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.">Jeremiah 9:16</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/42-16.htm" title="Then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which you feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof you were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there you shall die.">Jeremiah 42:16-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-14.htm" title="And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.">Ezekiel 12:14</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:14-39 After God has set the blessing before them which would make them a happy people if they would be obedient, he here sets the curse before them, the evils which would make them miserable, if they were disobedient. Two things would bring ruin. 1. A contempt of God's commandments. They that reject the precept, will come at last to renounce the covenant. 2. A contempt of his corrections. If they will not learn obedience by the things they suffer, God himself would be against them; and this is the root and cause of all their misery. And also, The whole creation would be at war with them. All God's sore judgments would be sent against them. The threatenings here are very particular, they were prophecies, and He that foresaw all their rebellions, knew they would prove so. TEMPORAL judgments are threatened. Those who will not be parted from their sins by the commands of God, shall be parted from them by judgments. Those wedded to their lusts, will have enough of them. SPIRITUAL judgments are threatened, which should seize the mind. They should find no acceptance with God. A guilty conscience would be their continual terror. It is righteous with God to leave those to despair of pardon, who presume to sin; and it is owing to free grace, if we are not left to pine away in the iniquity we were born in, and have lived in.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sanctuaries - The holy places in the tabernacle and the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-35.htm">Psalm 68:35</a>.

Eating the flesh of their own children is mentioned first, as indicating the extremity of the misery and wretchedness in which the people would perish; and after this, the judgment, by which the nation would be brought to this extremity, is more minutely described in its four principal features: viz., (1) the destruction of all idolatrous abominations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>); (2) the overthrow of the towns and sanctuaries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31</a>); (3) the devastation of the land, to the amazement of the enemies who dwelt therein (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-32.htm">Leviticus 26:32</a>); and (4) the dispersion of the people among the heathen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>). The "high places" are altars erected upon heights and mountains in the land, upon which sacrifices were offered both to Jehovah in an unlawful way and also to heathen deities. &#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, sun-pillars, are idols of the Canaanitish nature-worship, either simple pillars dedicated to Baal, or idolatrous statues of the sun-god (cf. Movers Phnizier i. pp. 343ff.). "And I give your carcases upon the carcases of your idols." &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, lit., clods, from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500; to roll, a contemptuous expression for idols. With the idols the idolaters also were to perish, and defile with their corpses the images, which had also become corpses as it were, through their overthrow and destruction. For the further execution of this threat, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-4.htm">Ezekiel 6:4</a>. This will be your lot, for "My soul rejects you." By virtue of the inward character of His holy nature, Jehovah must abhor and reject the sinner. </body></html>
