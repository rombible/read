(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-23.htm" title="And when you shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised to you: it shall not be eaten of.">Leviticus 19:23</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-26.htm" title="Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.">Jeremiah 9:26</a>.) The same metaphor is used by the Apostle: “Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-51.htm" title="You stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do you.">Acts 7:51</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Accept of the punishment of their iniquity.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">accept willingly, </span>that is, they will acknowledge the justice of their punishment, and be in that frame of mind when they will freely own that the punishment is not commensurate with their guilt, and willingly accept the Divine retribution. The exact shade of meaning covered by this phrase in the original cannot adequately be given in a translation, since the verb here translated “accept,” or “accept willingly,” is the same which is translated “enjoy” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-34.htm" title="Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.">Leviticus 26:34</a>. The whole phrase denotes literally, <span class= "ital">they shall rejoice in their iniquity, </span>or <span class= "ital">in the punishment of their iniquity; </span>they will take it joyfully, as the best and most appropriate means to bring them to repentance. The nearest approach to it is the passage, “I will bear the indignation of the Lord, for I have sinned against him” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-9.htm" title="I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.">Micah 7:9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-41.htm" title="And that I also have walked contrary to them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:">Leviticus 26:41</a></span>. <span class="ital">If they accept of </span>— The meaning is, if they sincerely acknowledge the righteousness of God and their own wickedness, and patiently submit to his correcting hand; if, with David, they are ready to say, <span class="ital">It is good for us that we are afflicted, that we may learn God’s statutes — </span>And yield obedience to them for the future, which is a good evidence of true repentance.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:40-46 Among the Israelites, persons were not always prosperous or afflicted according to their obedience or disobedience. But national prosperity was the effect of national obedience, and national judgments were brought on by national wickedness. Israel was under a peculiar covenant. National wickedness will end in the ruin of any people, especially where the word of God and the light of the gospel are enjoyed. Sooner or later, sin will be the ruin, as well as the reproach, of every people. Oh that, being humbled for our sins, we might avert the rising storm before it bursts upon us! God grant that we may, in this our day, consider the things which belong to our eternal peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Uncircumcised hearts - The outward sign of the covenant might be preserved, but the answering grace in the heart would be wanting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-10.htm">Jeremiah 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>).<p>Accept of the punishment of their iniquity - literally, enjoy their iniquity. The word here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-43.htm">Leviticus 26:43</a> rendered "accept" in this phrase, is the same as is rendered "enjoy" in the expression "the land shall enjoy her sabbaths" <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-34.htm">Leviticus 26:34</a>. The antithesis in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-43.htm">Leviticus 26:43</a> is this: The land shall enjoy her sabbaths - and they shall enjoy the punishment of their iniquity. The meaning is, that the land being desolate shall have the blessing of rest, and they having repented shall have the blessing of chastisement. The feelings of a devout captive Israelite are beautifully expressed in Tobit 13:1-18. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40-45. If they shall confess their iniquity, &c.&#8212;This passage holds out the gracious promise of divine forgiveness and favor on their repentance, and their happy restoration to their land, in memory of the covenant made with their fathers (Ro 2:1-29).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The Hebrew word <span class="ital">avou</span> commonly signifies <span class="ital">iniquity</span>, but it is oft used for <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the punishment of iniquity, </span> as here and <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-10.htm" title="And Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD lives, there shall no punishment happen to you for this thing.">1 Samuel 28:10</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-10.htm" title="For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength fails because of my iniquity, and my bones are consumed.">Psalm 31:10</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-6.htm" title="All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.">Isaiah 53:6</a>,11</span>. The meaning is, if they sincerely acknowledge the righteousness of God, and their own wickedness, and patiently submit to his correcting hand, and would rather be in their present suffering condition than in their former sinful, though prosperous estate; if with David they are ready to say, <span class="ital">it is good for them that they are afflicted, that they may learn God’s statutes</span>, and obedience to them for the future, which is a good evidence of true repentance. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And that I also have walked contrary unto them,.... Showed no regard unto them, as if he took no care of them, or in a providential way concerned himself for them, but let what would befall them; yea, came out in the way of his judgments against them, as if he was an enemy to them; see Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-24.htm">Leviticus 26:24</a>, <p>and have brought them into the land of their enemies; should acknowledge the hand of God in it, that he himself brought them out of their own country into an enemy's land, as Assyria, Babylon, and other nations: and that this was not the chance of war, or owing to the superior power or skill of their enemies, but to the just judgment of God upon them for their sins, who on that account delivered them up into the hands of their enemies: <p>if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled; their foolish proud heart, as the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan; it signifies a sinful, wicked, hard, and impenitent heart, brought to a sense of sin, to repentance and humiliation for it. Jarchi interprets it, "or if their uncircumcised heart", &amp;c. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23</a>; and observes another sense of the word, "perhaps their uncircumcised heart", &amp;c. not only would in words confess their sins, but be truly humbled at heart for them: <p>and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity; take it well at the hand of God, bear it patiently without murmuring, or thinking themselves hardly dealt by, but freely owning it is less than their iniquities deserve; or complete and finish the punishment of their sins, as Aben Ezra, which upon their humiliation should be put an end to, and cease. Jarchi takes the word in the sense of atonement and pacification, as if by their chastisement their sins were expiated (d), and God was pacified toward them: but rather it denotes the free and full pardon of their sins, manifested to them upon their repentance and humiliation for sin. <p>(d) Siphri apud Yalkut, ut supra.

The keeping of the Sabbath was not a performance binding upon the land, nor had the land been in fault because the Sabbath was not kept. As the earth groans under the pressure of the sin of men, so does it rejoice in deliverance from this pressure, and participation in the blessed rest of the whole creation. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514; &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;: the land "will rest (keep) what it has not rested on your Sabbaths and whilst you dwelt in it;" i.e., it will make up the rest which you did not give it on your Sabbaths (daily and yearly). It is evident from this, that the keeping of the Sabbaths and sabbatical years was suspended when the apostasy of the nation increased, - a result which could be clearly foreseen in consequence of the inward dislike of a sinner to the commandments of the holy God, and which is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-21.htm">2 Chronicles 26:21</a> as having actually occurred. </body></html>
