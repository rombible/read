These two diseases also occur together in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-22.htm" title="The LORD shall smite you with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue you until you perish.">Deuteronomy 28:22</a>, the only passage in the Bible where they occur again. The second of the two, however, which is here translated “burning ague” in the Authorised Version, is, in the Deuteronomy passage, rendered simply by “fever.” The two passages ought to be uniformly rendered.<p><span class= "bld">That shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">that shall extinguish the eyes, and cause life to waste away. </span>The rendering of the Authorised Version, “consume the eyes,” though giving the sense, is misleading, inasmuch as it suggests that the verb “consume” is the same as the disease, “consumption” mentioned in the preceding clause. For the phrase “extinguish the eye”—the eye failing—see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-20.htm" title="But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.">Job 11:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-5.htm" title="He that speaks flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.">Job 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-16.htm" title="If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;">Job 31:16</a>, &c, and for the whole phrase, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-65.htm" title="And among these nations shall you find no ease, neither shall the sole of your foot have rest: but the LORD shall give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:">Deuteronomy 28:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-23.htm" title="And he said to them, Why do you such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.">1Samuel 2:23</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</span>—Besides these terrible diseases, the production of the soil, which is necessary for the sustenance of life, and which is to be so abundant and secure against enemies when the Israelites obey the Divine commandments (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/26-4.htm" title="Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.">Leviticus 26:4-6</a>), will be carried off by strangers. Similar threatenings in case of disobedience are to be found both in the Pentateuch (Deut. xxviii, 33, 51) and in the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-17.htm" title="And they shall eat up your harvest, and your bread, which your sons and your daughters should eat: they shall eat up your flocks and your herds: they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees: they shall impoverish your fenced cities, wherein you trusted, with the sword.">Jeremiah 5:17</a>). The most striking parallel is the one in Micah, “Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-15.htm" title="You shall sow, but you shall not reap; you shall tread the olives, but you shall not anoint you with oil; and sweet wine, but shall not drink wine.">Micah 6:15</a>). For the reverse state of things, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-8.htm" title="The LORD has sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give your corn to be meat for your enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink your wine, for the which you have labored:">Isaiah 62:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/65-22.htm" title="They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.">Isaiah 65:22-23</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-16.htm" title="I also will do this to you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.">Leviticus 26:16</a></span>. <span class="ital">I will appoint over you terror — </span>The original <span class="ital">word, </span><span class="greekheb">בהלה</span>, <span class="ital">behalah, </span>properly signifies a sudden and grievous consternation, and may be intended to denote that slavish fear, pusillanimity, and dejection which are consequent on the loss of confidence in God, and the testimony of a good conscience. <span class="ital">Consumption — </span>The word <span class="greekheb">שׁחפת</span>, <span class="ital">shachpeth, </span>thus rendered here, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-22.htm" title="The LORD shall smite you with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue you until you perish.">Deuteronomy 28:22</a>, is of very uncertain signification. In the Septuagint it is translated <span class="greekheb">ψωραν</span>, <span class="ital">psoran, a scab, scall, the itch, </span>or some cutaneous eruption, perhaps the small pox, or some such grievous complaint. <span class="ital">The burning ague </span>(or <span class="ital">fever, </span>as the word <span class="greekheb">קדחת</span>, <span class="ital">kaddachath </span>evidently signifies) <span class="ital">that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart — </span>Two remarkable effects of this distemper, when it continues long.

Two things would bring ruin. 1. A contempt of God's commandments. They that reject the precept, will come at last to renounce the covenant. 2. A contempt of his corrections. If they will not learn obedience by the things they suffer, God himself would be against them; and this is the root and cause of all their misery. And also, The whole creation would be at war with them. All God's sore judgments would be sent against them. The threatenings here are very particular, they were prophecies, and He that foresaw all their rebellions, knew they would prove so. TEMPORAL judgments are threatened. Those who will not be parted from their sins by the commands of God, shall be parted from them by judgments. Those wedded to their lusts, will have enough of them. SPIRITUAL judgments are threatened, which should seize the mind. They should find no acceptance with God. A guilty conscience would be their continual terror. It is righteous with God to leave those to despair of pardon, who presume to sin; and it is owing to free grace, if we are not left to pine away in the iniquity we were born in, and have lived in.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The first warning for disobedience is disease. "Terror" (literally trembling) is rendered trouble in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-33.htm">Psalm 78:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-23.htm">Isaiah 65:23</a>. It seems here to denote that terrible affliction, an anxious temperament, the mental state ever at war with Faith and Hope. This might well be placed at the head of the visitations on a backslider who had broken the covenant with his God. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-25.htm">Deuteronomy 32:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-8.htm">Jeremiah 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-17.htm">Job 24:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>.<p>Consumption, and the burning ague - Compare the margin reference. The first of the words in the original comes from a root signifying to waste away; the latter (better, fever), from one signifying to kindle a fire. Consumption is common in Egypt and some parts of Asia Minor, but it is more rare in Syria. Fevers of different kinds are the commonest of all diseases in Syria and all the neighboring countries. The opposite promise to the threat is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-25.htm">Exodus 23:25</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

According to the Septuagint, "ague" is "the jaundice," which disorders the eyes and produces great depression of spirits. Others, however, consider the word as referring to a scorching wind; no certain explanation can be given.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I will even appoint over you; </span> I will give them power over you, that you shall not be able to avoid or resist them.

Henceforward follow threatenings of dreadful evils to the transgressors and despisers of the commandments of God, which thus begin: <p>I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart; some, as Aben Ezra observes, take these to design what may affect the seed sown and the increase of it, such as blasting and mildew, because it follows: "ye shall sow in vain"; but no doubt diseases of the body are intended; for what we translate "terror" does not signify terror of mind, but some sudden, hasty, terrible distemper; perhaps the pestilence, as the Targum of Jonathan; some have thought of the falling sickness, as Bishop Patrick, because the word has the signification of haste and precipitance; and the second is a disease well known among us, and so called from its wasting and consuming nature; Jarchi interprets it of a disease which swells the flesh, either fills it with tumours and pustules, the Septuagint calls it the itch; or with wind or water, which has led some to think of the dropsy; and the last of them seems to be rightly rendered a burning ague or fever, though the Septuagint takes it for the jaundice, but that seems not to be so threatening, terrible, and dangerous, as what may be here supposed: now these diseases and all others are by the appointment of God, they come and go by his order, and while they continue have the power over persons, nor can they rid themselves of them at pleasure; and these have such an effect on persons seized by them, as to cause dimness of sight, a hollowness of their eyes, which sink into the head, as well as fill the heart with grief and sorrow; either through present pains and agonies, or in a view of future judgment and wrath to come: <p>and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it; either eat it up for forage before it is ripe, or, if ripe and gathered in the barn, should come and besiege their cities and plunder their granaries. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/leviticus/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">terror</span>] i.e. terrible things, viz. those that follow.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the soul</span>] your life.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Notwithstanding their numerous increase, they would suffer no want of food.
