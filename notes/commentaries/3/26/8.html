While Israel maintained a national regard to God's worship, sabbaths, and sanctuary, and did not turn aside to idolatry, the Lord engaged to continue to them temporal mercies and religious advantages. These great and precious promises, though they relate chiefly to the life which now is, were typical of the spiritual blessings made sure by the covenant of grace to all believers, through Christ. 1. Plenty and abundance of the fruits of the earth. Every good and perfect gift must be expected from above, from the Father of lights. 2. Peace under the Divine protection. Those dwell in safety, that dwell in God. 3. Victory and success in their wars. It is all one with the Lord to save by many or by few. 4. The increase of their people. The gospel church shall be fruitful. 5. The favour of God, which is the fountain of all Good. 6. Tokens of his presence in and by his ordinances. The way to have God's ordinances fixed among us, is to cleave closely to them. 7. The grace of the covenant. All covenant blessings are summed up in the covenant relation, I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; and they are all grounded upon their redemption. Having purchased them, God would own them, and never cast them off till they cast him off.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Five of you shall chase - A proverbial mode of expression for superiority in warlike prowess <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-17.htm">Isaiah 30:17</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time, &c.&#8212;The barley harvest in Judea was about the middle of April; the wheat harvest about six weeks after, or in the beginning of June. After the harvest came the vintage, and fruit gathering towards the latter end of July. Moses led the Hebrews to believe that, provided they were faithful to God, there would be no idle time between the harvest and vintage, so great would be the increase. (See Am 9:13). This promise would be very animating to a people who had come from a country where, for three months, they were pent up without being able to walk abroad because the fields were under water.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Five of you, </span> i.e. a small number; a certain number for an uncertain. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And five of you shall chase an hundred,....

Ye shall not make to you elilim, nugatory gods, and set up carved images and standing images for worship, but worship Jehovah your God with the observance of His Sabbaths, and fear before His sanctuary. The prohibition of elilim, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-4.htm">Leviticus 19:4</a>, calls to mind the fundamental law of the decalogue (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-23.htm">Leviticus 21:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-24.htm">Exodus 23:24-25</a>). To pesel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>) and mazzebah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-24.htm">Exodus 23:24</a>), which were not to be set up, there is added the command not to put &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1488;&#1489;&#1503;, "figure-stones," in the land, to worship over (by) them. The "figure-stone" is a stone formed into a figure, and idol of stone, not merely a stone with an inscription or with hieroglyphical figures; it is synonymous with &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/33-52.htm">Numbers 33:52</a>, and consequently we are to understand by pesel the wooden idol as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-15.htm">Isaiah 44:15</a>, etc. The construction of &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1492; with &#1506;&#1500; may be explained on the ground that the worshipper of a stone image placed upon the ground rises above it (for &#1506;&#1500; in this sense, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-2.htm">Genesis 18:2</a>). - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-3.htm">Leviticus 26:3</a> the true way to serve God is urged upon the Israelites once more, in words copied verbally from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-30.htm">Leviticus 19:30</a>. </body></html>
