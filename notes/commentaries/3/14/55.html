The same word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-52.htm">Leviticus 14:52</a>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-53.htm">Leviticus 14:53</a> it is said, "and make an atonement for it." Such language is used figuratively when it is applied to things, not to persons. The leprosy in houses, the leprosy in clothing, and the terrible disease in the human body, were representative forms of decay which taught the lesson that all created things, in their own nature, are passing away, and are only maintained for their destined uses during an appointed period, by the power of Yahweh. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>48-57. the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed&#8212;The precautions here described show that there is great danger in warm countries from the house leprosy, which was likely to be increased by the smallness and rude architecture of the houses in the early ages of the Israelitish history. As a house could not contract any impurity in the sight of God, the "atonement" which the priest was to make for it must either have a reference to the sins of its occupants or to the ceremonial process appointed for its purification, the very same as that observed for a leprous person. This solemn declaration that it was "clean," as well as the offering made on the occasion, was admirably calculated to make known the fact, to remove apprehension from the public mind, as well as relieve the owner from the aching suspicion of dwelling in an infected house.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And for the leprosy of a garment,....

The purpose was also the same, namely, to cleanse (&#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488; cleanse from sin) and make atonement for the house, i.e., to purify it from the uncleanness of sin which had appeared in the leprosy. For, although it is primarily in the human body that sin manifests itself, it spreads from man to the things which he touches, uses, inhabits, though without our being able to represent this spread as a physical contagion. </body></html>
