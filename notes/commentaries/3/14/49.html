Masters of families should be aware, and afraid of the first appearance of sin in their families, and put it away, whatever it is. If the leprosy is got into the house, the infected part must be taken out. If it remain in the house, the whole must be pulled down. The owner had better be without a dwelling, than live in one that was infected. The leprosy of sin ruins families and churches. Thus sin is so interwoven with the human body, that it must be taken down by death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Cleanse the house - Strictly, "purge the house from sin." The same word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-52.htm">Leviticus 14:52</a>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-53.htm">Leviticus 14:53</a> it is said, "and make an atonement for it." Such language is used figuratively when it is applied to things, not to persons. The leprosy in houses, the leprosy in clothing, and the terrible disease in the human body, were representative forms of decay which taught the lesson that all created things, in their own nature, are passing away, and are only maintained for their destined uses during an appointed period, by the power of Yahweh. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>48-57. the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed&#8212;The precautions here described show that there is great danger in warm countries from the house leprosy, which was likely to be increased by the smallness and rude architecture of the houses in the early ages of the Israelitish history. As a house could not contract any impurity in the sight of God, the "atonement" which the priest was to make for it must either have a reference to the sins of its occupants or to the ceremonial process appointed for its purification, the very same as that observed for a leprous person. This solemn declaration that it was "clean," as well as the offering made on the occasion, was admirably calculated to make known the fact, to remove apprehension from the public mind, as well as relieve the owner from the aching suspicion of dwelling in an infected house.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he shall take to cleanse the house,.... The priest, or by his fellow priest, as Aben Ezra, though some interpret it of the master of the house; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-49.htm">Leviticus 14:49</a>, an account is given of the manner of cleansing a leprous house, which is the same with that of cleansing a leprous man, see notes on  <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4-7</a>, <p>Two birds. The birds here indeed are not described as "alive and clean", <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4</a>; but both are plainly implied and the house is said to be cleansed with the blood of the slain bird, as well as with the living bird; and it was the upper door post of the house which was sprinkled seven times with it, but there were no sacrifices offered; in this case, as in the cleansing of the leper, the atonement for it was made by the other rites, which were sufficient to render it habitable again, and free for use, either of the owner or any other person: <p>and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.
