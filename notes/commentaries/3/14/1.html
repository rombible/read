(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,">Leviticus 13:1</a>.) The reason for this is probably that Moses was designed by God as the great law-giver and teacher of the priesthood as well as of the laity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/leviticus/14.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Leviticus<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE FIRST STAGE IN THE LEPER’S CLEANSING<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 14:1</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-7.htm" title="And he shall sprinkle on him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.">Leviticus 14:7</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The whole treatment of leprosy is parabolic. Leprosy itself is a ‘parable of death.’ The horrible loathsomeness, the contagiousness, the non-curableness, etc. So the man was shut out from camp and from sanctuary. There was a double process in the cleansing rite, restoring to each.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">I. Sketch the ceremonial.</span> Two birds, one slain over a vessel of water so that its blood drained in. Then the living bird was to be dipped into this water and blood, along with cedar, scarlet, and hyssop, and the man sprinkled seven times and the living bird set loose.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">II. The significance. </span>This elaborate symbolism was partly intelligible even then. Two birds, like the two goats on the Atonement Day. Did both in some sense symbolise the man? The first one was not exactly a sacrifice. Its death points to the physical death which was the end of the disease, but also in some sense its death symbolised the death by which cleansing was secured.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{<span class="ital">a</span>} The purifying water is made by blood added to it, <span class="ital">i.e</span>. cleansing by sacrifice.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘By water and by blood.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{<span class="ital">b</span>} The sevenfold sprinkling. The cedar, symbol of incorruptibility; the scarlet, of full vital energy; the hyssop, of purifying. So the thought was suggested of the communication of cleansing, full health and incorruption, undecaying strength; all physical contrasts to leprosy sevenfold.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{<span class="ital">c</span>} The free, glad activity. The freed bird. The restored leper.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 14:1</a></span>. The priests having been instructed in the foregoing chapter how to judge of the leprosy, are here directed concerning the kinds and manner of those sacrifices and ceremonies which were requisite for the legal purification of the leper, after the priest judged him to be healed, in order that he might be readmitted to the civil and religious privileges of the Jewish community.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-9 The priests could not cleanse the lepers; but when the Lord removed the plague, various rules were to be observed in admitting them again to the ordinances of God, and the society of his people. They represent many duties and exercises of truly repenting sinners, and the duties of ministers respecting them. If we apply this to the spiritual leprosy of sin, it intimates that when we withdraw from those who walk disorderly, we must not count them as enemies, but admonish them as brethren. And also that when God by his grace has brought to repentance, they ought with tenderness and joy, and sincere affection, to be received again. Care should always be taken that sinners may not be encouraged, nor penitents discouraged. If it were found that the leprosy was healed, the priest must declare it with the particular solemnities here described. The two birds, one killed, and the other dipped in the blood of the bird that was killed, and then let loose, may signify Christ shedding his blood for sinners, and rising and ascending into heaven. The priest having pronounced the leper clean from the disease, he must make himself clean from all remains of it. Thus those who have comfort of the remission of their sins, must with care and caution cleanse themselves from sins; for every one that has this hope in him, will be concerned to purify himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The leper was excluded not only from the sanctuary but from the camp.

This is the most minute of all the forms of purification, those for purification from contact with a dead body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19.htm">Numbers 19</a>) and for the cleansing of a defiled Nazarite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6</a>) being alone to be compared with it in this respect. Some purifications were accomplished, as we have seen, in a very summary manner: one who touched the carcass of a beast that had died a natural death had only to wash his clothes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-40.htm">Leviticus 11:40</a>). The greater and more significative the defilement, the more careful and the more significative must be the cleansing. Leprous uncleanness excluded the leper both from the camp and from the sanctuary, from the rights both of citizen. ship and of Church-membership, with which the rights of the family were also associated; consequently there had to be a double form of restoration, each with its special ceremonies. The manner of the first reconciliation is detailed in verses 1-8, of the second in verses 9-32. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>If the mole had not spread during the seven days, the priest was to cause the fabric in which the mole appeared to be washed, and then shut it up for seven days more.
