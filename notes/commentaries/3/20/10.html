(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-2.htm" title="Again, you shall say to the children of Israel, Whoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that gives any of his seed to Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.">Leviticus 20:2</a>.) This precept is also to be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-17.htm" title="And he that curses his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.">Exodus 21:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-20.htm" title="Whoever curses his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.">Proverbs 20:20</a>, and is referred to by our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-14.htm" title="Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.">Matthew 15:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-10.htm" title="For Moses said, Honor your father and your mother; and, Whoever curses father or mother, let him die the death:">Mark 7:10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">His blood shall be upon </span>him—That is, he has brought it upon himself to be killed. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-19.htm" title="And it shall be, that whoever shall go out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be on his head, and we will be guiltless: and whoever shall be with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be on him.">Joshua 2:19</a>.) This phrase, which occurs seven times either in the singular or plural, is only to be found in this chapter (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-9.htm" title="For every one that curses his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he has cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be on him.">Leviticus 20:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/20-11.htm" title="And the man that lies with his father's wife has uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be on them.">Leviticus 20:11-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-16.htm" title="And if a woman approach to any beast, and lie down thereto, you shall kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be on them.">Leviticus 20:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-27.htm" title="A man also or woman that has a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be on them.">Leviticus 20:27</a>). According to the authorities during the second Temple, it carried with it death by lapidation.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">Shall surely be put to death.</span>—This is, by penalty for the sin forbidden in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-20.htm" title="Moreover you shall not lie carnally with your neighbor's wife, to defile yourself with her.">Leviticus 18:20</a>. According to Jewish tradition whenever the phrase “shall surely be put to death” occurs by itself, it denotes death by strangling. This death was inflicted for six crimes—upon him who had commerce with another man’s wife; who smote his father or mother; (3) who stole an Israelite; (4) who being an elder rebelled against the decree of the senate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-12.htm" title="And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not listen to the priest that stands to minister there before the LORD your God, or to the judge, even that man shall die: and you shall put away the evil from Israel.">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>); (5) who played the false prophet; and (6) who prophesied in the name of another god.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm" title="And the man that commits adultery with another man's wife, even he that commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.">Leviticus 20:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">The adulterer and adulteress shall surely be put to death —</span>Adultery, however lightly it may be accounted of by men who are lost to all sense of virtue and honour, has not only under the Mosaic economy, but by several other civilized nations; been reckoned a capital wickedness. By the ancient laws of Solon the husband was authorized to kill the adulterer and adulteress, if he found them in the fact; or if he did not choose to proceed to that severity, he might put out their eyes. Among the Egyptians too, adulterers were punished with the utmost severity. If a woman were enticed to commit adultery, her nose was slit, and the man received a thousand blows with rods. To the same purpose, by the Roman laws, the adulterer might be put to death if he were taken in the act. Considering the heinous nature and fatal consequences of this vice, we need not wonder much, if, in well-regulated states, it has been punishable with death. By our laws a man shall lose his life by robbing another of a few shillings; but what proportion is there between robbing a man of a sum of money, and invading his property in what he often cherishes more tenderly than ease, plenty, honour, and even life itself?<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:10-27 These verses repeat what had been said before, but it was needful there should be line upon line.

Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy&#8212;The minute specification of the incestuous and unnatural crimes here enumerated shows their sad prevalence amongst the idolatrous nations around, and the extreme proneness of the Israelites to follow the customs of their neighbors. It is to be understood, that, whenever mention is made that the offender was "to be put to death" without describing the mode, stoning is meant. The only instance of another form of capital punishment occurs in Le 20:14, that of being burnt with fire; and yet it is probable that even here death was first inflicted by stoning, and the body of the criminal afterwards consumed by fire (Jos 7:15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife,....
