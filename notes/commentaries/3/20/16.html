What praises we owe to God that he has taught the evil of sin, and the sure way of deliverance from it! May we have grace to adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things; may we have no fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness, but reprove them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The burning under the sentence of the Law took place after the death of the criminal by stoning, or strangling. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-19. Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy&#8212;The minute specification of the incestuous and unnatural crimes here enumerated shows their sad prevalence amongst the idolatrous nations around, and the extreme proneness of the Israelites to follow the customs of their neighbors. It is to be understood, that, whenever mention is made that the offender was "to be put to death" without describing the mode, stoning is meant. The only instance of another form of capital punishment occurs in Le 20:14, that of being burnt with fire; and yet it is probable that even here death was first inflicted by stoning, and the body of the criminal afterwards consumed by fire (Jos 7:15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto,....
