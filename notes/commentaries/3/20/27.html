It ought rather to be translated “but;” that is, but because the Israelites are God’s holy ones, therefore every man or woman who pretends to disclose future events by means of necromancy, thus usurping the functions of God, is to be stoned to death. The case of these necromancers is here repeated, because in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-31.htm" title="Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 19:31</a> the consulting them only is forbidden, and in the sixth verse of this chapter the penalty for consulting them is set forth, whilst in the passage before us the penalty is enacted which the persons themselves who are convicted of practising these secret arts are to suffer. The woman is here expressly added, both because this art seems to have been principally followed by women (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-28.htm" title="You shall not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of your people.">Exodus 22:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-7.htm" title="Then said Saul to his servants, Seek me a woman that has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her.
