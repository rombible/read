(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-2.htm" title="Again, you shall say to the children of Israel, Whoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that gives any of his seed to Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.">Leviticus 20:2</a>.) In the following ten cases those guilty of the sins specified suffered this punishment: (1) the unchaste high priest’s daughter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-9.htm" title="And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profanes her father: she shall be burnt with fire.">Leviticus 21:9</a>); (2) he who had commerce with his daughter; (3)or with his daughter’s daughter; (4) or with his son’s daughter; (5) or with his wife’s daughter; (6) or with her daughter’s daughter; (7) or with her son’s daughter; (8) or with his mother-in-law; (9) or with the mother of his mother-in-law; and (10), or with the mother of his father-in-law. It will thus be seen that with the exception of the high priest’s daughter this death was only inflicted for incest. As the Bible nowhere states the precise mode in which this kind of death is to be carried out, the authorities during the second Temple maintained that it must be executed in such a manner as to leave the body externally un changed by the flames, because, when God himself inflicted this punishment, the dead bodies of Nadab and Abihu were in a perfect state of preservation. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-2.htm" title="And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.">Leviticus 10:2</a>.) To effect this the criminal was put into dung up to his knees, a soft cloth containing a hard one was then tied around his throat, while the two witnesses who had secured his sentence drew tighter by the two cords till the criminal opened his mouth, when molten lead was poured down his throat, thus burning him to death. Hence the ancient Chaldee Version renders it here, “they shall be burnt with fire, with melted lead in their mouth.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-14.htm" title="And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.">Leviticus 20:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">They — </span>All who consented to it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:10-27 These verses repeat what had been said before, but it was needful there should be line upon line.

Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy&#8212;The minute specification of the incestuous and unnatural crimes here enumerated shows their sad prevalence amongst the idolatrous nations around, and the extreme proneness of the Israelites to follow the customs of their neighbors. It is to be understood, that, whenever mention is made that the offender was "to be put to death" without describing the mode, stoning is meant. The only instance of another form of capital punishment occurs in Le 20:14, that of being burnt with fire; and yet it is probable that even here death was first inflicted by stoning, and the body of the criminal afterwards consumed by fire (Jos 7:15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">It is wickedness, </span> i.e. abominable and extraordinary wickedness, as the singularity of the punishment showeth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Both he and they; </span> either, or both or all of them, if they consented to it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And if a man take a wife, and her mother,....

But it was rather done with faggots, of which an instance is given: <p>that there be no wickedness among you; of such kind, continued, countenanced, and pass unpunished.
