Offerings were made to the Lord at his altar; and the people were taught to employ their time in prayer, and praise, and godly meditation. The sheaf of first-fruits was typical of the Lord Jesus, who is risen from the dead as the First-fruits of them that slept. Our Lord Jesus rose from the dead on the very day that the first-fruits were offered. We are taught by this law to honour the Lord with our substance, and with the first-fruits of all our increase, Pr 3:9. They were not to eat of their new corn, till God's part was offered to him out of it; and we must always begin with God: begin every day with him, begin every meal with him, begin every affair and business with him; seek first the kingdom of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sheaf - The original word, "omer", means either a sheaf <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-7.htm">Ruth 2:7</a>, or a measure <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-16.htm">Exodus 16:16</a>. Our version is probably right in this place. The offering which was waved <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30</a> was most likely a small sheaf of barley, the grain which is first ripe. The first fruits of the wheat harvest were offered seven weeks later in the loaves of Pentecost. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-15.htm">Leviticus 23:15-17</a>. The two offerings thus figure the very commencement and the completion of the grain harvest; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-22.htm">Ruth 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-23.htm">Ruth 2:23</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. ye shall bring a sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest&#8212;A sheaf, literally, an omer, of the first-fruits of the barley harvest. The barley being sooner ripe than the other grains, the reaping of it formed the commencement of the general harvest season. The offering described in this passage was made on the sixteenth of the first month, the day following the first Passover Sabbath, which was on the fifteenth (corresponding to the beginning of our April); but it was reaped after sunset on the previous evening by persons deputed to go with sickles and obtain samples from different fields. These, being laid together in a sheaf or loose bundle, were brought to the court of the temple, where the grain was winnowed, parched, and bruised in a mortar. Then, after some incense had been sprinkled on it, the priest waved the sheaf aloft before the Lord towards the four different points of the compass, took a part of it and threw it into the fire of the altar&#8212;all the rest being reserved to himself. It was a proper and beautiful act, expressive of dependence on the God of nature and providence&#8212;common among all people, but more especially becoming the Israelites, who owed their land itself as well as all it produced to the divine bounty. The offering of the wave-sheaf sanctified the whole harvest (Ro 11:16). At the same time, this feast had a typical character, and pre-intimated the resurrection of Christ (1Co 15:20), who rose from the dead on the very day the first-fruits were offered.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When ye be come into the land; </span> therefore this obliged them not in the desert, where they reaped no harvest, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall reap, </span> i.e. begin to reap, as it is expounded <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-9.htm" title="Seven weeks shall you number to you: begin to number the seven weeks from such time as you begin to put the sickle to the corn.">Deu 16:9</a></span>. <span class="ital">So, he begat</span>, i.e. began to beget, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-32.htm" title="And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.">Genesis 5:32</a> 11:26</span>; and, <span class="ital">he built</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.">1 Kings 6:1</a></span>, i.e. he began to build, as it is explained <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-2.htm" title="And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.">2 Chronicles 3:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">The harvest thereof</span>, to wit, barley harvest, which was before wheat harvest.

What is next observed, it being incumbent on them to do what is enjoined: <p>when ye be come into the land which I give unto you: the land of Canaan, which God had given by promise to their fathers and to them, and which they were now going to inherit: as yet they were in a wilderness, where there were no sowing nor reaping, nor any harvest; so that the following law, though now given, could not take place till they came into the land of Canaan: <p>and shall reap the harvest thereof; the barley harvest, which was about this time, the month Nisan, and which had the name Abib, from the barley being then in the ear, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31</a>; for the wheat harvest was not till seven weeks after: <p>then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest; to with it as after directed: this is called an omer in the text, which was the tenth part of an ephah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-36.htm">Exodus 16:36</a>; and so Jarchi interprets it here; according to the Jewish writers, when the sheaf was reaped, the corn was beat out and winnowed, and dried by the fire, and then ground in a mill, and an omer, or a tenth part of an ephah of the flour of it was taken, and oil and frankincense put upon it, an handful of which being put upon the altar, the rest was the priest's; and with this pretty much agrees the account Josephus gives, who says, on the second day of unleavened bread, which is the sixteenth (day of Nisan), of the fruits they have reaped they take a part; for they do not touch them before, accounting it just to honour God first, from whom they receive the plenty of these things; and bring the firstfruits of the barley after this manner, having dried the handful of ears, and bruised them, and cleansed them from the bran, they bring to the altar a tenth part to God, and casting one handful of it on the altar, they leave the rest for the use of the priests; and from thence forward it is lawful to reap publicly and privately (k): this has been in some part imitated by the Heathens: the Egyptians, who ascribe the invention of the fruits of the earth, particularly wheat and barley, to Isis and Osiris, in memory of it, and as a testimony of their gratitude for it, at the time of harvest, bring an handful of the first ears of corn, and beating themselves near them, call upon Isis; and in some cities, at the feast of Isis, vessels of wheat and barley were carried about in great pomp, as Diodorus Siculus (l) relates. <p>(k) Antiqu. l. 3. c. 10. sect. 5.
