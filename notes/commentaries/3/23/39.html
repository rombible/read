Christ's tabernacling on earth in human nature, might also be prefigured. And it represents the believer's life on earth: a stranger and pilgrim here below, his home and heart are above with his Saviour. They would the more value the comforts and conveniences of their own houses, when they had been seven days dwelling in the booths. It is good for those who have ease and plenty, sometimes to learn what it is to endure hardness. The joy of harvest ought to be improved for the furtherance of our joy in God. The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof; therefore whatever we have the comfort of, he must have the glory of, especially when any mercy is perfected. God appointed these feasts, Beside the sabbaths and your free-will offerings.

The mode in which the Feast of Tabernacles is here reintroduced, after the mention of it in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34-36</a>, may suggest that this passage originally formed a distinct document.<p>The fruit of the land - i. e. the produce, including the grain, the olives, the vintage and the fruits of all kinds.

It began on the fifteenth day of the month, corresponding to the end of our September and beginning of October, which was observed as a Sabbath; and it could be celebrated only at the place of the sanctuary, offerings being made on the altar every day of its continuance. The Jews were commanded during the whole period of the festival to dwell in booths, which were erected on the flat roofs of houses, in the streets or fields; and the trees made use of are by some stated to be the citron, the palm, the myrtle, and the willow, while others maintain the people were allowed to take any trees they could obtain that were distinguished for verdure and fragrance. While the solid branches were reserved for the construction of the booths, the lighter branches were carried by men, who marched in triumphal procession, singing psalms and crying "Hosanna!" which signifies, "Save, we beseech thee!" (Ps 118:15, 25, 26). It was a season of great rejoicing. But the ceremony of drawing water from the pool, which was done on the last day, seems to have been the introduction of a later period (Joh 7:37). That last day was the eighth, and, on account of the scene at Siloam, was called "the great day of the feast." The feast of ingathering, when the vintage was over, was celebrated also on that day [Ex 23:16; 34:22], and, as the conclusion of one of the great festivals, it was kept as a sabbath.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Also, </span> or rather, <span class="ital">surely</span>, as this particle is oft used; for this is no addition of a new, but only a repetition of the former injunction, with a more particular explication both of the manner and reason of the feast. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The fruit, </span> not the corn, which was gathered long before, but of their trees, as vines, olives, and other fruit-trees; which completed the harvest, whence this is called <span class="ital">the feast of ingathering</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-16.htm" title="And the feast of harvest, the first fruits of your labors, which you have sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when you have gathered in your labors out of the field.">Exodus 23:16</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month,....

It appears, however, that the word signifies in this place rather products than fruits, namely, leaves and branches. The command, therefore, would be, <span class="cmt_word">ye shall take you...</span>  <span class="accented">products <span class="cmt_word"></span>of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brooks.</span> Originally, the purpose of these boughs was to make booths, as is shown by <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15, 16</a>, "Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written. So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths." <span class="cmt_word">And ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days.</span> Accordingly we find when the feast was observed by Ezra, after the long interval from the days of Joshua, "there was very great gladness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-17.htm">Nehemiah 8:17</a>). The reason of the injunction to dwell in booths is <span class="cmt_word">that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt;</span> that is, on the first night after they had been delivered from Egypt, and encamped at Succoth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>On the fifteenth of the same month the feast of Tabernacles was to be kept to the Lord for seven days: on the first day with a holy meeting and rest from all laborious work, and for seven days with sacrifices, as appointed for every day in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/29-13.htm">Numbers 29:13-33</a>. Moreover, on the eighth day, i.e., the 22nd of the month, the closing feast was to be observed in the same manner as on the first day (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34-36</a>). The name, "feast of Tabernacles" (booths), is to be explained from the fact, that the Israelites were to dwell in booths made of boughs for the seven days that this festival lasted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-42.htm">Leviticus 23:42</a>). &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514;, which is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-35.htm">Numbers 29:35</a> for the eighth day, which terminated the feast of Tabernacles, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-8.htm">Deuteronomy 16:8</a> for the seventh day of the feast of Mazzoth, signifies the solemn close of a feast of several days, clausula festi, from &#1506;&#1510;&#1512; to shut in, or close (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-2.htm">Genesis 16:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-17.htm">Deuteronomy 11:17</a>, etc.), not a coagendo, congregando populo ad festum, nor a cohibitione laboris, ab interdicto opere, because the word is only applied to the last day of the feasts of Mazzoth and Tabernacles, and not to the first, although this was also kept with a national assembly and suspension of work. But as these clausaulae festi were holidays with a holy convocation and suspension of work, it was very natural that the word should be transferred at a later period to feasts generally, on which the people suspended work and met for worship and edification (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-20.htm">2 Kings 10:20</a>). The azareth, as the eighth day, did not strictly belong to the feast of Tabernacles, which was only to last seven days; and it was distinguished, moreover, from these seven days by a smaller number of offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-35.htm">Numbers 29:35</a>.). The eighth day was rather the solemn close of the whole circle of yearly feasts, and therefore was appended to the close of the last of these feasts as the eighth day of the feast itself (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a> seq.). - With <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a> the enumeration of all the yearly feasts on which holy meetings were to be convened is brought to an end. This is stated in the concluding formula (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-37.htm">Leviticus 23:37</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-38.htm">Leviticus 23:38</a>), which answers to the heading in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-4.htm">Leviticus 23:4</a>, in which the Sabbaths are excepted, as they simply belonged to the moadim in the more general sense of the word. In this concluding formula, therefore, there is no indication that <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-2.htm">Leviticus 23:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-3.htm">Leviticus 23:3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-39.htm">Leviticus 23:39-43</a> are later additions to the original list of feasts which were to be kept with a meeting for worship. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1500;&#1492;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; (to offer, etc.) is not dependent upon "holy convocations," but upon the main idea, "feasts of Jehovah." Jehovah had appointed moadim, fixed periods in the year, for His congregation to offer sacrifices; not as if no sacrifices could be or were to be offered except at these feasts, but to remind His people, through these fixed days, of their duty to approach the Lord with sacrifices. &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; is defined by the enumeration of four principal kinds of sacrifice-burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, slain (i.e., peace-) offerings, and drink-offerings. &#1489;&#1468; &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;: "every day those appointed for it," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-13.htm">Exodus 5:13</a>. </body></html>
