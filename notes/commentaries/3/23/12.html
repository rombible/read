Offerings were made to the Lord at his altar; and the people were taught to employ their time in prayer, and praise, and godly meditation. The sheaf of first-fruits was typical of the Lord Jesus, who is risen from the dead as the First-fruits of them that slept. Our Lord Jesus rose from the dead on the very day that the first-fruits were offered. We are taught by this law to honour the Lord with our substance, and with the first-fruits of all our increase, Pr 3:9. They were not to eat of their new corn, till God's part was offered to him out of it; and we must always begin with God: begin every day with him, begin every meal with him, begin every affair and business with him; seek first the kingdom of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the morrow after the sabbath - It is most probable that these words denote the 16th of Abib, the day after the first day of holy convocation (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-5.htm">Leviticus 23:5-8</a> note), and that this was called "the Sabbath of the Passover", or, "the Sabbath of unleavened bread".<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. ye shall bring a sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest&#8212;A sheaf, literally, an omer, of the first-fruits of the barley harvest. The barley being sooner ripe than the other grains, the reaping of it formed the commencement of the general harvest season. The offering described in this passage was made on the sixteenth of the first month, the day following the first Passover Sabbath, which was on the fifteenth (corresponding to the beginning of our April); but it was reaped after sunset on the previous evening by persons deputed to go with sickles and obtain samples from different fields. These, being laid together in a sheaf or loose bundle, were brought to the court of the temple, where the grain was winnowed, parched, and bruised in a mortar. Then, after some incense had been sprinkled on it, the priest waved the sheaf aloft before the Lord towards the four different points of the compass, took a part of it and threw it into the fire of the altar&#8212;all the rest being reserved to himself. It was a proper and beautiful act, expressive of dependence on the God of nature and providence&#8212;common among all people, but more especially becoming the Israelites, who owed their land itself as well as all it produced to the divine bounty. The offering of the wave-sheaf sanctified the whole harvest (Ro 11:16). At the same time, this feast had a typical character, and pre-intimated the resurrection of Christ (1Co 15:20), who rose from the dead on the very day the first-fruits were offered.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">An he lamb, </span> besides the daily morning and evening sacrifice, which it was needless to mention here, and besides one of those sacrifices to be offered every day of the seven, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-8.htm" title="But you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:8</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And ye shall offer that day, when ye wave the sheaf,....

To this there is appended a fresh regulation in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-9.htm">Leviticus 23:9-14</a>, with the repetition of the introductory clause, "And the Lord spake," etc. When the Israelites had come into the land to be given them by the Lord, and had reaped the harvest, they were to bring a sheaf as first-fruits of their harvest to the priest, that he might wave it before Jehovah on the day after the Sabbath, i.e., after the first day of Mazzoth. According to Josephus and Philo, it was a sheaf of barley; but this is not expressly commanded, because it would be taken for granted in Canaan, where the harvest began with the barley. In the warmer parts of Palestine the barley ripens about the middle of April, and is reaped in April or the beginning of May, whereas the wheat ripens two or three weeks later (Seetzen; Robinson's Pal. ii. 263, 278). The priest was to wave the sheaf before Jehovah, i.e., to present it symbolically to Jehovah by the ceremony of waving, without burning any of it upon the altar. The rabbinical rule, viz., to dry a portion of the ears by the fire, and then, after rubbing them out, to burn them on the altar, was an ordinance of the later scribes, who knew not the law, and was based upon <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-14.htm">Leviticus 2:14</a>. For the law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-14.htm">Leviticus 2:14</a> refers to the offerings of first-fruits made by private persons, which are treated of in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12-13</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-2.htm">Deuteronomy 26:2</a>. The sheaf of first-fruits, on the other hand, which was to be offered before Jehovah as a wave-offering in the name of the congregation, corresponded to the two wave-loaves which were leavened and then baked, and were to be presented to the Lord as first-fruits (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-17.htm">Leviticus 23:17</a>). As no portion of these wave-loaves was burned upon the altar, because nothing leavened was to be placed upon it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-11.htm">Leviticus 2:11</a>), but they were assigned entirely to the priests, we have only to assume that the same application was intended by the law in the case of the sheaf of first-fruits, since the text only prescribes the waving, and does not contain a word about roasting, rubbing, or burning the grains upon the altar. &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514; &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1514; (the morrow after the Sabbath) signifies the next day after the first day of the feast of Mazzoth, i.e., the 16th Abib (Nisan), not the day of the Sabbath which fell in the seven days' feast of Mazzoth, as the Baethoseans supposed, still less the 22nd of Nisan, or the day after the conclusion of the seven days' feast, which always closed with a Sabbath, as Hitzig imagines.<p>(Note: The view advocated by the Baethoseans, which has been lately supported by W. Schultz, is refuted not only by <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-11.htm">Joshua 5:11</a>, but by the definite article used, &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;, which points back to one of the feast-days already mentioned, and still more decisively by the circumstance, that according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-15.htm">Leviticus 23:15</a> the seven weeks, at the close of which the feast of Pentecost was to be kept, were to be reckoned from this Sabbath; and if the Sabbath was not fixed, but might fall upon any day of the seven days' feast of Mazzoth, and therefore as much as give or six days after the Passover, the feast of Passover itself would be forced out of the fundamental position which it occupied in the series of annual festivals (cf. Ranke, Pentateuch ii. 108). Hitzig's hypothesis has been revived by Hupfeld and Knobel, without any notice of the conclusive refutation given to it by B&#1492;hr and Wieseler; only Knobel makes "the Sabbath" not the concluding but the opening Sabbath of the feast of Passover, on the ground that "otherwise the festal sheaf would not have been offered till the 22nd of the month, and therefore would have come post festum." But this hypothesis, which renders it necessary that the commencement of the ecclesiastical year should always be assigned to a Saturday (Sabbath), in order to gain weekly Sabbaths for the 14th and 21st of the month, as the opening and close of the feast of Passover, gives such a form to the Jewish year as would involve its invariably closing with a broken week; a hypothesis which is not only incapable of demonstration, but, from the holiness attached to the Jewish division of weeks, is a priori improbable, and in fact inconceivable. The Mosaic law, which gave such sanctity to the division of time into weeks, as founded upon the history of creation, by the institution of the observance of the Sabbath, that it raised the Sabbath into the groundwork of a magnificent festal cycle, could not possibly have made such an arrangement with regard to the time for the observance of the Passover, as would involve almost invariably the mutilation of the last week of the year, and an interruption of the old and sacred weekly cycle with the Sabbath festival at its close. The arguments by which so forced a hypothesis is defended, must be very conclusive indeed, to meet with any acceptance. But neither Hitzig nor his followers have been able to adduce any such arguments as these. Besides the word "Sabbath" and <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-11.htm">Joshua 5:11</a>, which prove nothing at all, the only other argument adduced by Knobel is, that "it is impossible to see why precisely the second day of the azyma, when the people went about their ordinary duties, and there was no meeting at the sanctuary, should have been distinguished by the sacrificial gift which was the peculiar characteristic of the feast," - an argument based upon the fallacious principle, that anything for which I can see no reason, cannot possibly have occurred.)<p>The "Sabbath" does not mean the seventh day of the week, but the day of rest, although the weekly Sabbath was always the seventh or last day of the week; hence not only the seventh day of the week (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/31-15.htm">Exodus 31:15</a>, etc.), but the day of atonement (the tenth of the seventh month), is called "Sabbath," and "Shabbath shabbathon" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-32.htm">Leviticus 23:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-31.htm">Leviticus 16:31</a>). As a day of rest, on which no laborious work was to be performed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-8.htm">Leviticus 23:8</a>), the first day of the feast of Mazzoth is called "Sabbath," irrespectively of the day of the week upon which it fell; and "the morrow after the Sabbath" is equivalent to "the morrow after the Passover" mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-11.htm">Joshua 5:11</a>, where "Passover" signifies the day at the beginning of which the paschal meal was held, i.e., the first day of unleavened bread, which commenced on the evening of the 14th, in other words, the 15th Abib. By offering the sheaf of first-fruits of the harvest, the Israelites were to consecrate their daily bread to the Lord their God, and practically to acknowledge that they owed the blessing of the harvest to the grace of God. They were not to eat any bread or roasted grains of the new corn till they had presented the offering of their God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-14.htm">Leviticus 23:14</a>). This offering was fixed for the second day of the feast of the Passover, that the connection between the harvest and the Passover might be kept in subordination to the leading idea of the Passover itself (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>.). But as the sheaf was not burned upon the altar, but only presented symbolically to the Lord by waving, and then handed over to the priests, an altar-gift had to be connected with it, - namely, a yearling sheep as a burnt-offering, a meat-offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, and a drink-offering of a quarter of a hin of wine, - to give expression to the obligation and willingness of the congregation not only to enjoy their earthly food, but to strengthen all the members of their body for growth in holiness and diligence in good works. The burnt-offering, for which a yearling lamb was prescribed, as in fact for all the regular festal sacrifices, was of course in addition to the burnt-offerings prescribed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/28-19.htm">Numbers 28:19-20</a>, for every feast-day. The meat-offering, however, was not to consist of one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour, as on other occasions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/28-9.htm">Numbers 28:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/28-13.htm">Numbers 28:13</a>, etc.), but of two-tenths, that the offering of corn at the harvest-feast might be a more plentiful one than usual. </body></html>
