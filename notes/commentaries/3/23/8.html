Offerings were made to the Lord at his altar; and the people were taught to employ their time in prayer, and praise, and godly meditation. The sheaf of first-fruits was typical of the Lord Jesus, who is risen from the dead as the First-fruits of them that slept. Our Lord Jesus rose from the dead on the very day that the first-fruits were offered. We are taught by this law to honour the Lord with our substance, and with the first-fruits of all our increase, Pr 3:9. They were not to eat of their new corn, till God's part was offered to him out of it; and we must always begin with God: begin every day with him, begin every meal with him, begin every affair and business with him; seek first the kingdom of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sacrifices here meant are named in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/28-19.htm">Numbers 28:19-24</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Le 23:5-8. The Passover.<p>5. the Lord's passover&#8212;(See Ex 12:2, 14, 18). The institution of the passover was intended to be a perpetual memorial of the circumstances attending the redemption of the Israelites, while it had a typical reference to a greater redemption to be effected for God's spiritual people. On the first and last days of this feast, the people were forbidden to work [Le 23:7, 8]; but while on the Sabbath they were not to do any work, on feast days they were permitted to dress meat&#8212;and hence the prohibition is restricted to "no servile work." At the same time, those two days were devoted to "holy convocation"&#8212;special seasons of social devotion. In addition to the ordinary sacrifices of every day, there were to be "offerings by fire" on the altar (see Nu 28:19), while unleavened bread was to be eaten in families all the seven days (see 1Co 5:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Seven days, the matter and manner whereof, see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-18.htm" title="In the first day shall be an holy convocation; you shall do no manner of servile work therein:">Numbers 28:18</a></span>, &c. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But ye shall offer an offering made by, fire unto the Lord seven days,....

This is most clearly stated in the heading (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-2.htm">Leviticus 23:2</a>): "the festal times of Jehovah, which ye shall call out as holy meetings, these are they, My feasts," i.e., those which are to be regarded as My feasts, sanctified to Me. The festal seasons and days were called "feasts of Jehovah," times appointed and fixed by Jehovah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14</a>), not because the feasts belonged to fixed times regulated by the course of the moon (Knobel), but because Jehovah had appointed them as days, or times, which were to be sanctified to Him. Hence the expression is not only used with reference to the Sabbath, the new moon, and the other yearly feasts; but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-2.htm">Numbers 28:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-39.htm">Numbers 29:39</a> it is extended so as to include the times of the daily morning and evening sacrifice. (On the "holy convocation" see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-16.htm">Exodus 12:16</a>.) </body></html>
