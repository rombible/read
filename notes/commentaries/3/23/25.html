(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-7.htm" title="In the first day you shall have an holy convocation: you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">But ye shall offer.</span>—As the festival is also the new moon, a threefold sacrifice was offered on it, (1) viz. the ordinary daily sacrifice which was offered first; (2) the appointed new moon sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/28-11.htm" title="And in the beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt offering to the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot;">Numbers 28:11-15</a>); and (3) the sacrifice for this festival, which consisted of a young bullock, a ram, and seven lambs of the first year, with the usual meat offerings, and a kid for a sin offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/29-1.htm" title="And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have an holy convocation; you shall do no servile work: it is a day of blowing the trumpets to you.">Numbers 29:1-6</a>). With the exception, therefore, of there being one bullock instead of two, this sacrifice was simply a repetition of the monthly offering by which it was preceded in the service. During the offering of the drink offering and the burnt offering the Levites engaged in vocal and instrumental music, singing the eighty-first and other psalms, whilst the priests at stated intervals broke forth with awful blasts of the trumpets. After the offering up of the sacrifices, the service was concluded by the priests, who pronounced the benediction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/6-23.htm" title="Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, On this wise you shall bless the children of Israel, saying to them,">Numbers 6:23-27</a>), which the people received in a prostrate position before the Lord. Having prostrated themselves a second time in the court, the congregation resorted to the adjoining synagogue, where the appointed lessons from the Law and the Prophets were read, consisting of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/21-1.htm" title="And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had spoken.">Genesis 21:1-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/29-1.htm" title="And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have an holy convocation; you shall do no servile work: it is a day of blowing the trumpets to you.">Numbers 29:1-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm" title="Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:">1Samuel 1:1</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-10.htm" title="The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder on them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.">1Samuel 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/22-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said to him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.">Genesis 22:1-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/31-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, The people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.">Jeremiah 31:2-20</a>. Psalms were recited and the festival prayers were offered, beseeching the Lord to pardon the sins of the past year, and to grant the people a happy new year. This concluded the morning service, after which the families resorted to their respective homes, partook of the social and joyous repast, and in the evening went again into the Temple to witness the offering of the evening sacrifices, and to see the candlestick lighted with which the festival concluded, all wishing each other, “May you be written down for a happy new year; may the Creator decree for you a happy new year.” To which was responded, “And you likewise.” With the exception of the sacrifices, the Jews keep this festival to the present day. The trumpet which they use on this occasion consists of the curved horn of a ram, in remembrance of the ram which Abraham sacrificed instead of Isaac. This event, as we have seen, is also commemorated in the lesson of the day.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:23-32 the blowing of trumpets represented the preaching of the gospel, by which men are called to repent of sin, and to accept the salvation of Christ, which was signified by the day of atonement. Also it invited to rejoice in God, and become strangers and pilgrims on earth, which was denoted by the feast of Tabernacles, observed in the same month. At the beginning of the year, they were called by this sound of trumpet to shake off spiritual drowsiness, to search and try their ways, and to amend them. The day of atonement was the ninth day after this; thus they were awakened to prepare for that day, by sincere and serious repentance, that it might indeed be to them a day of atonement. The humbling of our souls for sin, and the making our peace with God, is work that requires the whole man, and the closest application of mind. On that day God spake peace to his people, and to his saints; therefore they must lay aside all their wordly business, that they might the more clearly hear that voice of joy and gladness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A sabbath - Here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-39.htm">Leviticus 23:39</a> a word which should rather be rendered a sabbatical rest.<p>Blowing of trumpets - Here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/29-1.htm">Numbers 29:1</a>, literally "shouting". There is no mention of trumpets in the Hebrew text of the Law in connection with the day. However, there is no reason to doubt the tradition that the day was distinguished by a general blowing of trumpets throughout the land, and that the kind of trumpet generally used for the purpose was the curved horn of an animal or a cornet of metal, such as was used at Sinai <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>, and on the Day of Jubilee <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-9.htm">Leviticus 25:9</a>. It must have differed in this respect from the ordinary festival of the New moon when the long straight trumpet of the temple alone was blown (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-2.htm">Numbers 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-23.htm">Exodus 25:23</a>; see cut).<p>Seventh month - Called by the Jews in later times it was called Tisri, but in the Old Testament Ethanim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a>. According to the uniform voice of tradition "the first day" of this month was the first day of the Civil year in use before the Exodus, and was observed as the festival of the New year. Some have viewed it as a commemoration of the Creation of the world <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a> : others, as the anniversary of the giving of the Law. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.
