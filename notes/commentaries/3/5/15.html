If a man put to his own use unwittingly, any thing dedicated to God, he was to bring this sacrifice. We are to be jealous over ourselves, to ask pardon for the sin, and make satisfaction for the wrong, which we do but suspect ourselves guilty of. The law of God is so very broad, the occasions of sin in this guilty of. The law of God is so very broad, the occasions of sin in this world are so numerous, and we are so prone to evil, that we need to fear always, and to pray always, that we may be kept from sin. Also we should look before us at every step. The true Christian daily pleads guilty before God, and seeks forgiveness through the blood of Christ. And the gospel salvation is so free, that the poorest is not shut out; and so full, that the most burdened conscience may find relief from it.

The non-payment of tithes and offerings was looked upon as robbing Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-8.htm">Malachi 3:8</a>), and therefore it is that a trespass offering, involving compensation, and not only a sin offering, is required to atone for the offense. The ram that is to be offered is to be of a value fixed by the priest (<span class="cmt_word">with thy estimation</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to the estimation of the priest), and the priest is to estimate it <span class="cmt_word">by shekels of silver</span>; implying that its value must amount at least to <span class="accented">shekels</span> (in the plural), meaning two shekels (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>, where "portions" means "more than one portion," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "two portions").

Full satisfaction is the marked feature of the trespass offering. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>, "Zacchaeus stood, and said,...  Behold, Lord,...  if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I restore fourfold." He went far beyond his legal obligation in respect to compensation. (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-6.htm">2 Samuel 12:6</a>, "He shall restore the lamb fourfold.") <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"But if his hand does not reach what is sufficient for a sheep," i.e., if he could not afford enough to sacrifice a sheep ("his hand" is put for what his hand acquires), he was to bring two turtle-doves or two young pigeons, one for the sin-offering, the other for the burnt-offering. The pigeon intended for the sin, i.e., for the sin-offering, he was to bring first of all to the priest, who was to offer it in the following manner. The head was to be pinched off from opposite to its neck, i.e., in the nape just below the head, though without entirely severing it, that is to say, it was to be pinched off sufficiently to kill the bird and allow the blood to flow out. He was then to sprinkle of the blood upon the wall of the altar, which could be effected by swinging the bleeding pigeon, and to squeeze out the rest of the blood against the wall of the altar, because it was a sin-offering; for in the burnt-offering he let all the blood flow out against the wall of the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-15.htm">Leviticus 1:15</a>). What more was done with the pigeon is not stated. Hence it cannot be decided with certainty, whether, after the crop and its contents were removed and thrown upon the ash-heap, the whole of the bird was burned upon the altar, or whether it fell to the priest, as the Mishnah affirms (Seb. vi. 4), so that none of it was placed upon the altar. One circumstance which seems to favour the statement in the Talmud is the fact, that in the sin-offering of pigeons, a second pigeon was to be offered as a burnt-offering, and, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-10.htm">Leviticus 5:10</a>, for the purpose of making an atonement; probably for no other purpose than to burn it upon the altar, as the dove of the sin-offering was not burned, and the sacrifice was incomplete without some offering upon the altar. In the case of sin-offerings of quadrupeds, the fat portions were laid upon the altar, and the flesh could be eaten by the priest by virtue of his office; but in that of pigeons, it was not possible to separate fat portions from the flesh for the purpose of burning upon the altar by themselves, and it would not do to divide the bird in half, and let one half be burned and the other eaten by the priest, as this would have associated the idea of halfness or incompleteness with the sacrifice. A second pigeon was therefore to be sacrificed as a burnt-offering, &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, according to the right laid down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-14.htm">Leviticus 1:14</a>., that the priest might make atonement for the offerer on account of his sin, whereas in the sin-offering of a quadruped one sacrificial animal was sufficient to complete the expiation.<p>(Note: From the instructions to offer two pigeons in order to obtain expiation, it is perfectly evident that the eating of the flesh of the sin-offering on the part of the priest formed an essential part of the act of expiation, and was not merely a kind of honourable tribute, which God awarded to His servants who officiated at the sacrifice.)</body></html>
