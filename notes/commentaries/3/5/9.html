The blood is simply to be thrown on the walls of the altar, whilst in the ordinary sin offering, the priest had not only to dip his finger seven times in the blood of the victim, but had to put it on <span class= "ital">the horns </span>of the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/4-6.htm" title="And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the veil of the sanctuary.">Leviticus 4:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/4-17.htm" title="And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the veil.">Leviticus 4:17-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-25.htm" title="And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering.">Leviticus 4:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-30.htm" title="And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.">Leviticus 4:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-34.htm" title="And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:">Leviticus 4:34</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/5-9.htm" title="And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering....">Leviticus 5:9-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">It is a sin-offering — </span>This is added as the reason why its blood was so sprinkled and spilt. <span class="ital">According to the manner — </span>Or <span class="ital">order, </span>appointed by God. <span class="ital">The priest shall make an atonement — </span>Either declaratively, he shall pronounce him to be pardoned; or typically, with respect to Christ.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-13 The offences here noticed are, 1. A man's concealing the truth, when he was sworn as a witness to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. If, in such a case, for fear of offending one that has been his friend, or may be his enemy, a man refuses to give evidence, or gives it but in part, he shall bear his iniquity. And that is a heavy burden, which, if some course be not taken to get it removed, will sink a man to hell. Let all that are called at any time to be witnesses, think of this law, and be free and open in their evidence, and take heed of prevaricating. An oath of the Lord is a sacred thing, not to be trifled with. 2. A man's touching any thing that was ceremonially unclean. Though his touching the unclean thing only made him ceremonially defiled, yet neglecting to wash himself according to the law, was either carelessness or contempt, and contracted moral guilt. As soon as God, by his Spirit, convinces our consciences of any sin or duty, we must follow the conviction, as not ashamed to own our former mistake. 3. Rash swearing, that a man will do or not do such a thing. As if the performance of his oath afterward prove unlawful, or what cannot be done. Wisdom and watchfulness beforehand would prevent these difficulties. In these cases the offender must confess his sin, and bring his offering; but the offering was not accepted, unless accompanied with confession and humble prayer for pardon. The confession must be particular; that he hath sinned in that thing. Deceit lies in generals; many will own they have sinned, for that all must own; but their sins in any one particular they are unwilling to allow. The way to be assured of pardon, and armed against sin for the future, is to confess the exact truth. If any were very poor, they might bring some flour, and that should be accepted. Thus the expense of the sin-offering was brought lower than any other, to teach that no man's poverty shall ever bar the way of his pardon. If the sinner brought two doves, one was to be offered for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering. We must first see that our peace be made with God, and then we may expect that our services for his glory will be accepted by him. To show the loathsomeness of sin, the flour, when offered, must not be made grateful to the taste by oil, or to the smell by frankincense. God, by these sacrifices, spoke comfort to those who had offended, that they might not despair, nor pine away in their sins. Likewise caution not to offend any more, remembering how expensive and troublesome it was to make atonement.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-14.htm">Leviticus 1:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-8.htm">Leviticus 12:8</a>.

The trespass offering appointed in such cases was a female lamb or kid; if unable to make such an offering, he might bring a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons&#8212;the one to be offered for a sin offering, the other for a burnt offering; or if even that was beyond his ability, the law would be satisfied with the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour without oil or frankincense.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is added as the reason why its blood was so sprinkled and spilt.

And so Ben Gersom observes; from hence we learn, says he, that the sprinkling of the sin offering of the fowl was in the lower part of the altar; and I think this sprinkling, adds he, was not in the length, but in the breadth: <p>and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar; the blood sprinkled was that which dropped from it when nipped by the priest; this here was squeezed out by him, and was shed at the foot of the altar; so that the altar had all the blood, and nothing but the blood of the fowl, all the rest belonged to the priest (e): this might be an emblem both of the drops of blood which fell from Christ in the garden, and of the shedding of his blood upon the cross, whereby remission of sin was obtained, and atonement made: <p>it is a sin offering; an offering whereby sin was typically expiated and stoned. <p>(c)   , Sept.
