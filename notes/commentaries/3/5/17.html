In the canonical exposition, which obtained during the second Temple, of these sacrificial laws, the trespass offering enacted here is called “The Doubtful Offering,” in contradistinction to the one enacted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/5-14.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 5:14-16</a>, which is called “The Certain Offering.”<p><span class= "bld">These things.</span>—That is, the holy things of the Lord specified in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-15.htm" title="If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass to the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with your estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.">Leviticus 5:15</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Though he wist it not, </span><span class= "ital">i.e., </span>is uncertain about it.

(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-5.htm" title="Said he not to me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands have I done this.">Genesis 20:5</a>, &c, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-1.htm" title="And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.">2Samuel 20:1</a>, &c.)<p>Yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.—Still, he feels that he may be guilty of the transgression, and consequently is burdened with the weight of his iniquity. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm" title="And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness, whether he has seen or known of it; if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.">Leviticus 5:1</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-17.htm" title="And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he knew it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.">Leviticus 5:17</a></span>.

If a man put to his own use unwittingly, any thing dedicated to God, he was to bring this sacrifice. We are to be jealous over ourselves, to ask pardon for the sin, and make satisfaction for the wrong, which we do but suspect ourselves guilty of. The law of God is so very broad, the occasions of sin in this guilty of. The law of God is so very broad, the occasions of sin in this world are so numerous, and we are so prone to evil, that we need to fear always, and to pray always, that we may be kept from sin. Also we should look before us at every step. The true Christian daily pleads guilty before God, and seeks forgiveness through the blood of Christ. And the gospel salvation is so free, that the poorest is not shut out; and so full, that the most burdened conscience may find relief from it. Yet the evil of sin is so displayed as to cause every pardoned sinner to abhor and dread it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Though he wist it not - Ignorance of the Law, or even of the consequences of the act at the time that it was committed, was not to excuse him from the obligation to offer the sacrifice. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17-19. if a soul sin &#8230; though he wist it not, yet is he guilty&#8212;This also refers to holy things, and it differs from the preceding in being one of the doubtful cases,&#8212;that is, where conscience suspects, though the understanding be in doubt whether criminality or sin has been committed. The Jewish rabbis give, as an example, the case of a person who, knowing that "the fat of the inwards" is not to be eaten, religiously abstained from the use of it; but should a dish happen to have been at table in which he had reason to suspect some portion of that meat was intermingled, and he had, inadvertently, partaken of that unlawful viand, he was bound to bring a ram as a trespass offering [Le 5:16]. These provisions were all designed to impress the conscience with the sense of responsibility to God and keep alive on the hearts of the people a salutary fear of doing any secret wrong.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Any of these things, </span> to wit, concerning holy things, of which he is yet speaking, though with some difference and addition, as it may seem.

In what respect do these sins (which here require a Guilt-Offering) differ from those in ch. 4 for which a Sin-Offering is prescribed? The difference is indicated in the words ‘though he knew (‘wist’ A.V.) <span class="ital">it</span> not.’ They are not the same as the Heb. expression rendered <span class="ital">unwittingly</span> (<span class="ital">concerning his ignorance</span> A.V.), for in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-18.htm" title="And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with your estimation, for a trespass offering, to the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and knew it not, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 5:18</a></span> they occur as a further qualification of a thing done ‘unwittingly.’ The sins of ch. 4. are those of which a person <span class="ital">becomes conscious</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-14.htm" title="When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-23.htm" title="Or if his sin, wherein he has sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish:">Leviticus 4:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-28.htm" title="Or if his sin, which he has sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he has sinned.">Leviticus 4:28</a>). In such case he must offer a Sin-Offering. But the case here supposed is that of one who fears that he has been guilty of some infringement of the Divine commands, but <span class="ital">cannot specify it</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He brings a ram as Guilt-Offering (in the same manner as in the preceding case (15, 16)), but no restitution is demanded as the amount cannot be estimated, since the offence remains unknown. This sacrifice was called by the Jews (<span class="ital">’âshâm tâluy</span>), lit. a suspended Guilt or Trespass-Offering. It was a voluntary offering, and relieved a troubled conscience. It is recorded of one pious Jew that he brought a sacrifice of this kind every day except on the day following the Great Day of Atonement.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-19.</span> Sins of commission may be atoned for by the trespass offering as well as sins of omission. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But if any one could not afford even two pigeons, he was to offer the tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a sin-offering. &#1497;&#1491;&#1493; &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1497;&#1490; for &#1497;&#1491;&#1493; &#1514;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-7.htm">Leviticus 5:7</a>): his hand reaches to anything, is able to raise it, or with an accusative, obtains, gets anything (used in the same sense in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-30.htm">Leviticus 14:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-31.htm">Leviticus 14:31</a>), or else absolutely, acquires, or gets rich (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-26.htm">Leviticus 25:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-47.htm">Leviticus 25:47</a>). But it was to be offered without oil and incense, because it was a sin-offering, that is to say, "because it was not to have the character of a minchah" (Oehler). But the reason why it was not to have this character was, that only those who were in a state of grace could offer a minchah, and not a man who had fallen from grace through sin. As such a man could not offer to the Lord the fruits of the Spirit of God and of prayer, he was not allowed to add oil and incense, as symbols of the Spirit and praise of God, to the sacrifice with which he sought the forgiveness of sin. The priest was to take a handful of the meal offered, and burn it upon the altar as a memorial, and thus make atonement for the sinner on account of his sin. - On "his handful" and "a memorial" (Azcarah), see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-2.htm">Leviticus 2:2</a>.
