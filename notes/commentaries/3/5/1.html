The first instance adduced is that of failing to come forward as witness after the judicial adjuration has been uttered. It was the duty of every member of the community to aid the authorities in maintaining the integrity of the Divine law. Hence, when an offence was committed which the constituted tribunals were unable to bring home to the offender for want of evidence, a solemn adjuration was addressed by the judge to individual members, to a district, or to the whole community. If after such an adjuration, anyone who was cognizant of the offence failed to come forward to testify what he knew, he was considered in the sight of God as participating in the transgression which he had thus concealed. It is with reference to this law that we are told, “whoso is partner with a thief, hateth his own soul, he heareth cursing and betrayeth it not,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>he hears the adjuration of the judges, and yet stifles his evidence, and thus becomes a partner with the culprit. An instance of this adjuration is recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-63.htm" title="But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you be the Christ, the Son of God.">Matthew 26:63</a>, where the high priest said to Jesus, “I adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the son of God,” and it was in recognition of the solemn obligation of this adjuration that Jesus answered the question.<p><span class= "bld">Then he shall bear his iniquity.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">and he beareth his iniquity; </span>that is, he is sensible that he bears the load of this guilt, he has become conscious of his sin, without which he could not bring the sacrifice here prescribed. The phrase, “and he beareth his guilt,” has the same meaning as and “he,” or “they are guilty” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-13.htm" title="And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;">Leviticus 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-22.htm" title="When a ruler has sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty;">Leviticus 4:22</a>, &c. Unlike the sins committed inadvertently, spoken of in the preceding chapter, where the sin offering is prescribed, the guilt here described is that of designed and culpable silence, and of deliberately concealing a crime.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm" title="And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness, whether he has seen or known of it; if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.">Leviticus 5:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">And hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness — </span>The meaning seems to be, If a person sin, in not revealing the <span class="ital">voice of swearing, </span>which he <span class="ital">has seen, </span>that is, been a witness to, or been present when it was said, or <span class="ital">known </span>by sufficient information from others. But it must be observed, that the word, <span class="greekheb">אלה</span>, <span class="ital">alah, </span>here used, probably means <span class="ital">cursing, blasphemy, </span>or <span class="ital">execration, </span>and that either against one’s neighbour, or against God. This seems to be principally intended here, if not also, as many suppose, <span class="ital">false swearing, </span>for the crime spoken of is of so high a nature, that he who heard it was obliged to reveal it, and prosecute the guilty. Some think the expression ought to be rendered, <span class="ital">The voice of adjuration, </span>or <span class="ital">being adjured in the name of God, </span>when he is called to be a witness in a cause, <span class="ital">to speak the truth. </span>For in those countries the judges were wont to demand, in court, of accused persons or witnesses, in the name of God, to declare the whole truth; and this laid the same obligation upon them, as the administering an oath now does with us. See instances of this, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-21.htm" title="Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say to the woman, The LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people, when the LORD does make your thigh to rot, and your belly to swell;">Numbers 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-31.htm" title="If any man trespass against his neighbor, and an oath be laid on him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before your altar in this house:">1 Kings 8:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-16.htm" title="And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you that you tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?">1 Kings 22:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-24.htm" title="Whoever is partner with a thief hates his own soul: he hears cursing, and denudes it not.">Proverbs 29:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-63.htm" title="But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you be the Christ, the Son of God.">Matthew 26:63</a>. <span class="ital">Whether he hath seen or known — </span>That is, according to this last sense of the expression, if he be adjured to declare what he can say of the matter in question, whether upon his own knowledge, or from information of credible persons. <span class="ital">If he do not utter it — </span>If he suppress the truth, or be guilty of prevaricating, or dissimulation. <span class="ital">He shall bear his iniquity — </span>That is, the punishment of his iniquity; for the word <span class="greekheb">עונ</span>, <span class="ital">gnavon, </span>has frequently that meaning. Let him not think it is no offence to suppress the truth, when so solemnly called upon to declare it. He is unclean and guilty, and in token of his repentance let him offer such a sacrifice for his sin as is prescribed, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-6.htm" title="And he shall bring his trespass offering to the LORD for his sin which he has sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin.">Leviticus 5:6</a>,) which belongs to this and all the following cases. The expression, <span class="ital">Shall bear his iniquity, </span>is very emphatic, and imports that guilt, like a grievous burden, shall lie heavy upon him. Houbigant, however, an acknowledged critic, prefers the former interpretation.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-13 The offences here noticed are, 1. A man's concealing the truth, when he was sworn as a witness to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. If, in such a case, for fear of offending one that has been his friend, or may be his enemy, a man refuses to give evidence, or gives it but in part, he shall bear his iniquity. And that is a heavy burden, which, if some course be not taken to get it removed, will sink a man to hell. Let all that are called at any time to be witnesses, think of this law, and be free and open in their evidence, and take heed of prevaricating. An oath of the Lord is a sacred thing, not to be trifled with. 2. A man's touching any thing that was ceremonially unclean. Though his touching the unclean thing only made him ceremonially defiled, yet neglecting to wash himself according to the law, was either carelessness or contempt, and contracted moral guilt. As soon as God, by his Spirit, convinces our consciences of any sin or duty, we must follow the conviction, as not ashamed to own our former mistake. 3. Rash swearing, that a man will do or not do such a thing. As if the performance of his oath afterward prove unlawful, or what cannot be done. Wisdom and watchfulness beforehand would prevent these difficulties. In these cases the offender must confess his sin, and bring his offering; but the offering was not accepted, unless accompanied with confession and humble prayer for pardon. The confession must be particular; that he hath sinned in that thing. Deceit lies in generals; many will own they have sinned, for that all must own; but their sins in any one particular they are unwilling to allow. The way to be assured of pardon, and armed against sin for the future, is to confess the exact truth. If any were very poor, they might bring some flour, and that should be accepted. Thus the expense of the sin-offering was brought lower than any other, to teach that no man's poverty shall ever bar the way of his pardon. If the sinner brought two doves, one was to be offered for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering. We must first see that our peace be made with God, and then we may expect that our services for his glory will be accepted by him. To show the loathsomeness of sin, the flour, when offered, must not be made grateful to the taste by oil, or to the smell by frankincense. God, by these sacrifices, spoke comfort to those who had offended, that they might not despair, nor pine away in their sins. Likewise caution not to offend any more, remembering how expensive and troublesome it was to make atonement.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Special occasions are mentioned on which sin-offerings are to be made with a particular confession of the offence for which atonement is sought <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-5.htm">Leviticus 5:5</a>.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a><p>Swearing - Adjuration.

A proclamation was issued calling any one who could give information, to come before the court and bear testimony to the guilt of a criminal; and the manner in which witnesses were interrogated in the Jewish courts of justice was not by swearing them directly, but adjuring them by reading the words of an oath: "the voice of swearing."

This injunction is a direct condemnation of the approved teaching of Italian moral theologians of paramount authority throughout the Roman Church, who maintain that, in case a crime is not known to others, a witness in a court of justice "may, nay, he is bound to, say that the accused has not committed it" (St. Alfonso de' Liguori, 'Theol.
