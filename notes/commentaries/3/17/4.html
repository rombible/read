When they entered Canaan, this only continued in respect of sacrifices. The spiritual sacrifices we are now to offer, are not confined to any one place. We have now no temple or altar that sanctifies the gift; nor does the gospel unity rest only in one place, but in one heart, and the unity of the Spirit. Christ is our Altar, and the true Tabernacle; in him God dwells among men. It is in him that our sacrifices are acceptable to God, and in him only. To set up other mediators, or other altars, or other expiatory sacrifices, is, in effect, to set up other gods. And though God will graciously accept our family offerings, we must not therefore neglect attending at the tabernacle.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blood shall be imputed unto that man - i. e. he has incurred guilt in shedding blood in an unlawful manner.<p>Cut off - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14</a> note.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3, 4. What man &#8230; killeth an ox&#8212;The Israelites, like other people living in the desert, would not make much use of animal food; and when they did kill a lamb or a kid for food, it would almost always be, as in Abraham's entertainment of the angels [Ge 18:7], an occasion of a feast, to be eaten in company. This was what was done with the peace offerings, and accordingly it is here enacted, that the same course shall be followed in slaughtering the animals as in the case of those offerings, namely, that they should be killed publicly, and after being devoted to God, partaken of by the offerers. This law, it is obvious, could only be observable in the wilderness while the people were encamped within an accessible distance from the tabernacle. The reason for it is to be found in the strong addictedness of the Israelites to idolatry at the time of their departure from Egypt; and as it would have been easy for any by killing an animal to sacrifice privately to a favorite object of worship, a strict prohibition was made against their slaughtering at home.

Near to which stood the altar of burnt offering to offer it upon, and the priests ready for such service: now the Lord would have every sacrifice brought thither <p>to offer an offering to the Lord before the tabernacle of the Lord; that it might be offered publicly, and be known to be offered to the Lord, and not to idols or devils, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-7.htm">Leviticus 17:7</a>; and so to prevent private idolatry, and private persons from intruding into the priest's office; and this was typical of the acceptance of all spiritual sacrifices in the church of God, through Christ the minister of the tabernacle, which God pitched, and not man; and who is the door into the house of God, where such sacrifices are publicly to be offered up: <p>blood shall be imputed unto that man, he hath shed blood; which though it was only the blood of a beast, yet being shed as a sacrifice for man, and typical of the blood of Christ to be shed for man, was sacred and precious to God; and therefore he resented the shedding of it to any but himself, or by any person, or in any place but by his appointment; such a man was to be punished as a murderer, idolatry being equally heinous in the sight of God as murder, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-3.htm">Isaiah 66:3</a>, <p>and that man shall be cut off from among his people; not merely excommunicated from the church of God, deprived of the privileges of his house, but even put to death; for such a man was guilty of blood, that is, of death, and therefore to be put to death either by the hand of the civil magistrate, if his case was known and came under their cognizance, or by the immediate hand of God by a premature death, which seems to be chiefly intended; also see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:</span><p>(c) I abhor it as much as if he had killed a man as in Is 66:3.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/leviticus/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">the tent of meeting … the tabernacle</span>] For the significance of the double indication of place which suggests a combination of two sources see p. 88.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - In case a man offers a sacrifice elsewhere than at <span class="cmt_word">the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,...  blood shall be imputed unto that man;</span> that is, it shall no longer be regarded as a sacrifice at all, but an unjustifiable shedding of blood, for which he is to be cut off from among his people, that is, excommunicated. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the future, the priest who was anointed and set apart for the duty of the priesthood in his father's stead, i.e., the existing high priest, was to perform the act of expiation in the manner prescribed, and that "once a year." The yearly repetition of the general atonement showed that the sacrifices of the law were not sufficient to make the servant of God perfect according to this own conscience. And this imperfection of the expiation, made with the blood of bullocks and goats, could not fail to awaken a longing for the perfect sacrifice of the eternal High Priest, who has obtained eternal redemption by entering once, through His own blood, into the holiest of all (<a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7-12</a>). And just as this was effected negatively, so by the fact that the high priest entered on this day into the holiest of all, as the representative of the whole congregation, and there, before the throne of God, completed its reconciliation with Him, was the necessity exhibited in a positive manner for the true reconciliation of man, and his introduction into a perfect and abiding fellowship with Him, and the eventual realization of this by the blood of the Son of God, our eternal High Priest and Mediator, prophetically foreshadowed. The closing words in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-34.htm">Leviticus 16:34</a>, "and he (i.e., Aaron, to whom Moses was to communicate the instructions of God concerning the feast of atonement, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a>) did as the Lord commanded Moses," are anticipatory in their character, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-50.htm">Exodus 12:50</a>. For the law in question could not be carried out till the seventh month of the current year, that is to say, as we find from a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-11.htm">Numbers 10:11</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-17.htm">Exodus 40:17</a>, not till after the departure of Israel from Sinai. </body></html>
