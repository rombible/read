When they entered Canaan, this only continued in respect of sacrifices. The spiritual sacrifices we are now to offer, are not confined to any one place. We have now no temple or altar that sanctifies the gift; nor does the gospel unity rest only in one place, but in one heart, and the unity of the Spirit. Christ is our Altar, and the true Tabernacle; in him God dwells among men. It is in him that our sacrifices are acceptable to God, and in him only. To set up other mediators, or other altars, or other expiatory sacrifices, is, in effect, to set up other gods. And though God will graciously accept our family offerings, we must not therefore neglect attending at the tabernacle.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, May bring their beasts for slaughter, which they (now) slaughter in the open field. even that they may bring them before Yahweh to the entrance of the tent of meeting unto the priests, and slaughter them as peace-offerings to Yahweh.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

Which, before the tabernacle was erected, they were used to offer there, as it was lawful for them to do, and on high places, but now unlawful; though sometimes this was dispensed with by the Lord, and was done by some of his prophets, as Samuel, David, and Elijah, though not by priests: <p>even that they may bring them unto the Lord, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest; by whom they were to be offered, and by him only, and which is a principal reason why they were ordered to be brought thither: <p>and offer them for peace offerings unto the Lord; which though only mentioned, include all others. These are only taken notice of because most frequent, and because most profitable to the people, having a part of them; wherefore if these were to be brought to the tabernacle, which came the nearest of any to their meals and feasts in their own houses, then much more burnt offerings, and sin offerings, in which the Lord, had so great a concern. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them <i>for</i> peace offerings unto the LORD.</span><p>(d) In that they were moved with foolish devotion to offer it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/leviticus/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>.

It follows that the command refers to sacrifice, not to mere slaughtering. Clark, taking the opposite view of the command, is obliged to change the translation, <span class="accented">sacrifices which they offer in the open field</span>, into "beasts for slaughter which they now slaughter in the open field" ('Speaker's Commentary'); but he has no authority for doing so. <span class="accented">Zabach</span> means always, in the Pentateuch, to slay in sacrifice. These field sacrifices, when offered to the Lord in the proper place and with the proper ceremonies, would become peace offerings unto the Lord. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the future, the priest who was anointed and set apart for the duty of the priesthood in his father's stead, i.e., the existing high priest, was to perform the act of expiation in the manner prescribed, and that "once a year." The yearly repetition of the general atonement showed that the sacrifices of the law were not sufficient to make the servant of God perfect according to this own conscience. And this imperfection of the expiation, made with the blood of bullocks and goats, could not fail to awaken a longing for the perfect sacrifice of the eternal High Priest, who has obtained eternal redemption by entering once, through His own blood, into the holiest of all (<a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7-12</a>). And just as this was effected negatively, so by the fact that the high priest entered on this day into the holiest of all, as the representative of the whole congregation, and there, before the throne of God, completed its reconciliation with Him, was the necessity exhibited in a positive manner for the true reconciliation of man, and his introduction into a perfect and abiding fellowship with Him, and the eventual realization of this by the blood of the Son of God, our eternal High Priest and Mediator, prophetically foreshadowed. The closing words in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-34.htm">Leviticus 16:34</a>, "and he (i.e., Aaron, to whom Moses was to communicate the instructions of God concerning the feast of atonement, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a>) did as the Lord commanded Moses," are anticipatory in their character, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-50.htm">Exodus 12:50</a>. For the law in question could not be carried out till the seventh month of the current year, that is to say, as we find from a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-11.htm">Numbers 10:11</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-17.htm">Exodus 40:17</a>, not till after the departure of Israel from Sinai. </body></html>
