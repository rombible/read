Hitherto the Divine communications were made to (1) Moses alone, without his being ordered to speak to any one else (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-14.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 5:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-12.htm" title="And the fire on the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order on it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.">Leviticus 6:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 8:1</a>, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 14:1</a>); (2) to Moses, with the command to speak to Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;">Leviticus 16:1</a>); (3) to Moses, with the command to speak to Aaron and his sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-17.htm" title="It shall not be baked with leaven.

In the chapter before us, however, the communication is made to Moses alone, and he is commanded not only to impart its contents to Aaron and his sons—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the priesthood—but “unto all the children of Israel,” or their representatives, at the same time. The pontiff and the priests are thus put on a level with the ordinary Israelite or the laity, as far as this regulation is concerned. There are only two other occasions on which this phrase is used again, viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-24.htm" title="And Moses told it to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel.">Leviticus 21:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-18.htm" title="Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them, Whatever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer to the LORD for a burnt offering;">Leviticus 22:18</a>.<p><span class= "bld">This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded.</span>—To emphasize the importance of the following law Moses is ordered by God to use this additional formula; whilst in other instances where it is used, when important statutes are enacted, Moses uses it of his own accord.

When they entered Canaan, this only continued in respect of sacrifices. The spiritual sacrifices we are now to offer, are not confined to any one place. We have now no temple or altar that sanctifies the gift; nor does the gospel unity rest only in one place, but in one heart, and the unity of the Spirit. Christ is our Altar, and the true Tabernacle; in him God dwells among men. It is in him that our sacrifices are acceptable to God, and in him only. To set up other mediators, or other altars, or other expiatory sacrifices, is, in effect, to set up other gods. And though God will graciously accept our family offerings, we must not therefore neglect attending at the tabernacle.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This chapter, in its immediate bearing on the daily life of the Israelites, stands as the first of four <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17.htm">Leviticus 17-20</a> which set forth practical duties, directing the Israelites to walk, not in the way of the pagan, but according to the ordinances of Yahweh. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 17<p>Le 17:1-16.

On that day the Israelites were to "afflict their souls," i.e., to fast, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-32.htm">Leviticus 23:32</a>, from the evening of the 9th till the evening of the 10th day. Every kind of work was to be suspended as on the Sabbath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>), by both natives and foreigners (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-49.htm">Exodus 12:49</a>), because this day was a high Sabbath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-15.htm">Exodus 31:15</a>). Both fasting and sabbatical rest are enjoined again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-27.htm">Leviticus 23:27</a>. and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/29-7.htm">Numbers 29:7</a>, on pain of death. The fasting commanded for this day, the only fasting prescribed in the law, is most intimately connected with the signification of the feast of atonement. If the general atonement made on this day was not to pass into a dead formal service, the people must necessarily enter in spirit into the signification of the act of expiation, prepare their souls for it with penitential feelings, and manifest this penitential state by abstinence from the ordinary enjoyments of life. To "afflict (bow, humble) the soul," by restraining the earthly appetites, which have their seat in the soul, is the early Mosaic expression for fasting (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;). The latter word came first of all into use in the time of the Judges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-6.htm">1 Samuel 7:6</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-13.htm">Psalm 35:13</a> : "I afflicted my soul with fasting"). "By bowing his soul the Israelite was to place himself in an inward relation to the sacrifice, whose soul was given for his soul; and by this state of mind, answering to the outward proceedings of the day, he was to appropriate the fruit of it to himself, namely, the reconciliation of his soul, which passed through the animal's death" (Baumgarten). </body></html>
