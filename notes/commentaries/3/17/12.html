The strangers are also prohibited eating blood, because they have submitted to the law of the land, and because their eating it would not only infringe the law which they have voluntarily adopted, but would lessen the horror with which such indulgence was regarded by the Jews. Hence the enforcement of this prohibition by the Apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-20.htm" title="But that we write to them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.">Acts 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-29.htm" title="That you abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if you keep yourselves, you shall do well. Fare you well.">Acts 15:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-25.htm" title="As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.">Acts 21:25</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:10-16 Here is a confirmation of the law against eating blood. They must eat no blood. But this law was ceremonial, and is now no longer in force; the coming of the substance does away the shadow. The blood of beasts is no longer the ransom, but Christ's blood only; therefore there is not now the reason for abstaining there then was. The blood is now allowed for the nourishment of our bodies; it is no longer appointed to make an atonement for the soul. Now the blood of Christ makes atonement really and effectually; to that, therefore, we must have regard, and not consider it as a common thing, or treat it with indifference.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, For the soul of the flesh is in the blood; and I have ordained it for you upon the altar, to make atonement for your souls, for the blood it is which makes atonement by means of the soul. In the Old Testament there are three words relating to the constitution of man;<p>(a) "life" as opposed to death <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-20.htm">Genesis 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-15.htm">Deuteronomy 30:15</a>;<p>(b) the "soul" as distinguished from the body; the individual life either in man or beast, whether united to the body during life, or separated from the body after death (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>);<p>(c) the "spirit" as opposed to the flesh <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-6.htm">Romans 8:6</a>, and as distinguished from the life of the flesh; the highest element in man; that which, in its true condition, holds communion with God. The soul has its abode in the blood as long as life lasts. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-14.htm">Leviticus 17:14</a>, the soul is identified with the blood, as it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-23.htm">Deuteronomy 12:23</a>. That the blood is rightly thus distinguished from all other constituents of the body is acknowledged by the highest authorities in physiology.<p>"It is the fountain of life (says Harvey), the first to live, and the last to die, and the primary seat of the animal soul; it lives and is nourished of itself, and by no other part of the human body." John Hunter inferred that it is the seat of life, because all the parts of the frame are formed and nourished from it. "And if (says he) it has not life previous to this operation, it must then acquire it in the act of forming: for we all give our assent to the existence of life in the parts when once formed." Milne Edwards observes that, "if an animal be bled until it falls into a state of syncope, and the further loss of blood is not prevented, all muscular motion quickly ceases, respiration is suspended, the heart pauses from its action, life is no longer manifested by any outward sign, and death soon becomes inevitable; but if, in this state, the blood of another animal of the same species be injected into the veins of the one to all appearance dead, we see with amazement this inanimate body return to life, gaining accessions of vitality with each new quantity of blood that is introduced, eventual beginning to breathe freely, moving with ease, and finally walking as it was wont to do, and recovering completely." More or less distinct traces of the recognition of blood as the vehicle of life are found in Greek and Roman writers. The knowledge of the ancients on the subject may indeed have been based on the mere observation that an animal loses its life when it loses its blood: but it may deepen our sense of the wisdom and significance of the Law of Moses to know that the fact which it sets forth so distinctly and consistently, and in such pregnant connection, is so clearly recognized by modern scientific research.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls&#8212;God, as the sovereign author and proprietor of nature, reserved the blood to Himself and allowed men only one use of it&#8212;in the way of sacrifices.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, no soul of you shall eat blood,....

The severity of this prohibition required some explanation, and this is given in the reason assigned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-5.htm">Leviticus 17:5-7</a>, viz., "that the Israelites may bring their slain-offerings, which they slay in the open field, before the door of the tabernacle, as peace-offerings to Jehovah," and "no more offer their sacrifices to the &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, after whom they go a whoring" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-7.htm">Leviticus 17:7</a>). This reason presupposes that the custom of dedicating the slain animals as sacrifices to some deity, to which a portion of them was offered, was then widely spread among the Israelites. It had probably been adopted from the Egyptians; though this is not expressly stated by ancient writers: Herodotus (i. 132) and Strabo (xv. 732) simply mentioning it as a Persian custom, whilst the law book of Manu ascribes it to the Indians. To root out this idolatrous custom from among the Israelites, they were commanded to slay every animal before the tabernacle, as a sacrificial gift to Jehovah, and to bring the slain-offerings, which they would have slain in the open field, to the priest at the tabernacle, as shelamim (praise-offerings and thank-offerings), that he might sprinkle the blood upon the altar, and burn the fat as a sweet-smelling savour for Jehovah (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2-5</a>). "The face of the field" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-5.htm">Leviticus 17:5</a>, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-7.htm">Leviticus 14:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-53.htm">Leviticus 14:53</a>): the open field, in distinction from the enclosed space of the court of Jehovah's dwelling. "The altar of Jehovah" is spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-6.htm">Leviticus 17:6</a> instead of "the altar" only (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-15.htm">Leviticus 11:15</a>, etc.), on account of the contrast drawn between it and the altars upon which they offered sacrifice to Seirim. &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, literally goats, is here used to signify daemones (Vulg.), "field-devils" (Luther), demons, like the &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-17.htm">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>, who were supposed to inhabit the desert (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-14.htm">Isaiah 34:14</a>), and whose pernicious influence they sought to avert by sacrifices. The Israelites had brought this superstition, and the idolatry to which it gave rise, from Egypt. The Seirim were the gods whom the Israelites worshipped and went a whoring after in Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-7.htm">Ezekiel 20:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-3.htm">Ezekiel 23:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-8.htm">Ezekiel 23:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-19.htm">Ezekiel 23:19</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-21.htm">Ezekiel 23:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-27.htm">Ezekiel 23:27</a>). Both the thing and the name were derived from the Egyptians, who worshipped goats as gods (Josephus c. <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/2.htm">Revelation 2</a>, 7), particularly Pan, who was represented in the form of a goat, a personification of the male and fertilizing principle in nature, whom they called Mendes and reckoned among the eight leading gods, and to whom they had built a splendid and celebrated temple in Thmuis, the capital of the Mendesian Nomos in Lower Egypt, and erected statues in the temples in all directions (cf. Herod. 2, 42, 46; Strabo, xvii. 802; Diod. Sic. i. 18). The expression "a statute for ever" refers to the principle of the law, that sacrifices were to be offered to Jehovah alone, and not to the law that every animal was to be slain before the tabernacle, which was afterwards repealed by Moses, when they were about to enter Canaan, where it could no longer be carried out (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-15.htm">Deuteronomy 12:15</a>). </body></html>
