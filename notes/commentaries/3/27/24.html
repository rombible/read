But if it took place after the year of jubilee, i.e., some time or some years after, the priest was to estimate the value according to the number of years to the next year of jubilee, and "it shall be abated from thy valuation," sc., praeteritum tempus, the time that has elapsed since the year of jubilee. Hence, for example, if the field was vowed ten years after the year of jubilee, the man who wished to redeem it had only forty shekels to pay for the forty years remaining up to the next year of jubilee, or, with the addition of the fifth, 48 shekels. The valuation was necessary in both cases, for the hereditary field was inalienable, and reverted to the original owner or his heirs in the year of jubilee without compensation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-21.htm">Leviticus 27:21</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-13.htm">Leviticus 25:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>.); so that, strictly speaking, it was not the field itself, but the produce of its harvests up to the next year of jubilee, that was vowed, whether the person making the vow left it to the sanctuary in natura till the year of jubilee, or wished to redeem it again by paying the valuation price. In the latter case, however, he had to put a fifth over and above the valuation price (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-19.htm">Leviticus 27:19</a>, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-13.htm">Leviticus 27:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-15.htm">Leviticus 27:15</a>), that it might be left to him.</body></html>
