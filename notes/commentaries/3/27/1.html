As sundry allusions are made throughout this book to vows, thus legally acknowledging the existence of the ancient practice of votive offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-16.htm" title="But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:">Leviticus 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-18.htm" title="Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them, Whatever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer to the LORD for a burnt offering;">Leviticus 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-21.htm" title="And whoever offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.">Leviticus 22:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-23.htm" title="Either a bullock or a lamb that has any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that may you offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.">Leviticus 22:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-38.htm" title="Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which you give to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:38</a>), the Levitical code, which is pre-eminently designed to uphold the holiness of the sanctuary and its sacrifices, as well as the holiness of the priests and the people, would be incomplete without defining the nature and obligation of these self-imposed sacrifices.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:1-13 Zeal for the service of God disposed the Israelites, on some occasions, to dedicate themselves or their children to the service of the Lord, in his house for life. Some persons who thus dedicated themselves might be employed as assistants; in general they were to be redeemed for a value. It is good to be zealously affected and liberally disposed for the Lord's service; but the matter should be well weighed, and prudence should direct as to what we do; else rash vows and hesitation in doing them will dishonour God, and trouble our own minds.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Dues.

The final chapter, attached to the book after the concluding exhortation, is a short treatise on persons (verses 2-8), animals (verses 9-13), houses (verses 14, 15), lauds (verses 16-24), vowed to God; and on the commutation of vows. A man might vow to the service of God whatever he had a right over, that is, himself, his wife, his children, his slaves, his beasts, his houses, his fields. In case persons were vowed, the rule was that they should be redeemed at a certain price, though occasionally the redemption was not made. Vowing a person to God thus, was, as a rule, no more than vowing so much money to the use of the sanctuary as was fixed as the price of the redemption of the person vowed. Yet there is a great difference between the two acts of vowing a person and vowing the correlative sum of money. A man in great danger or distress might devote himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-20.htm">Genesis 28:20</a>) or another (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-30.htm">Judges 11:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>) to God, when he never would have vowed money. Such vows were redeemable, and, as a rule, were redeemed, though there were some exceptions, as in the case of Samuel. If beasts were vowed to the Lord (verses 9-13), they could not be redeemed if they were such as could be sacrificed to him; if they were not such as could be sacrificed, they were to be valued by the priest, and either retained as a possession of the sanctuary, or, if the owner preferred it, redeemed by him at the price fixed and out-fifth additional. If houses were vowed to the Lord (verses 14, 15), they became the property of the sanctuary, unless they were redeemed at the valuation set upon them by the priest, with one-fifth additional. If hereditary lands were vowed to the Lord (verses 16-21), they became the possession of the sanctuary at the year of jubilee, unless they had been previously redeemed; redemption, however, was in this case the ordinary rule, and we do not hear of any accumulation of landed property in the hands of the priests from this source. In the case of a field which was not an hereditary possession, but a purchase, being vowed to the Lord (verses 22-24), the commutation sum was paid down "in that day," that is, on the spot in a lump sum, the land going back at the jubilee to the original owners from whom the temporary possession had been bought by the man who made the vow. A section is added forbidding the firstborn of animals, things devoted, and tithes to be vowed, because they were already the Lord's; allowing the redemption of the firstborn of unclean animals, and of the tithes of corn and fruits, but prohibiting redemption in the case of sacrificial animals, of things devoted, and of the tithes of animals. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this state of pining away under their enemies, they would confess to themselves their own and their fathers' sins, i.e., would make the discovery that their sufferings were a punishment from God for their sins, and acknowledge that they were suffering what they had deserved, through their unfaithfulness to their God and rebellion against Him, for which He had been obliged to set Himself in hostility to them, and bring them into the land of their enemies; or rather their uncircumcised hearts would then humble themselves, and they would look with satisfaction upon this fruit of their sin. The construction is the following: &#1493;&#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-42.htm">Leviticus 26:42</a>) corresponds to &#1492;&#1514;&#1493;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-40.htm">Leviticus 26:40</a>) as the apodosis; so that, according to the more strictly logical connection, which is customary in our language, we may unite <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-40.htm">Leviticus 26:40</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a> in one period with <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-42.htm">Leviticus 26:42</a>. "If they shall confess their iniquity...or rather their uncircumcised heart shall humble itself...I will remember My covenant." With &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1501; a parenthetical clause is introduced into the main sentence explanatory of the iniquity, and reaches as far as "into the land of their enemies." With &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506; &#1488;&#1493;&#1470;&#1488;&#1494;, "or if, etc.," the main sentence is resumed. &#1488;&#1493;, "or rather" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-3.htm">1 Samuel 29:3</a>), bringing out the humiliation of the heart as the most important result to which the confession of sin ought to deepen itself. The heart is called "uncircumcised" as being unsanctified, and not susceptible to the manifestations of divine grace. &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501; &#1497;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1509;&#787;&#1492;&#1503;&#1498;&#1495;&#769;&#1507;&#1503;&#1509;&#1507;&#1497; &#1508;&#1489;&#768;&#1506; &#1489;&#787;&#1500;&#1489;&#1505;&#1508;&#1497;&#769;&#1489;&#1506; &#1489;&#1509;&#787;&#1508;&#1513;&#834;&#1501; (lxx), they will take pleasure, rejoice in their misdeeds, i.e., in the consequences and results of them-that their misdeed have so deeply humbled them, and brought them to the knowledge of the corruption into which they have fallen: a bold and, so to speak, paradoxical expression for their complete change of heart, which we may render thus: "they will enjoy their misdeeds," as &#1512;&#1510;&#1492; may be rendered in the same way in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-43.htm">Leviticus 26:43</a> also.<p>(Note: Luther has translated &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; in this sense, "punishment of iniquity," and observes in the marginal notes, - "(Pleasure), i.e., just as they had pleasure in their sins and felt disgust at My laws, so they would now take pleasure in their punishment and say, 'We have just what we deserve. This is what we have to thank our cursed sin for. It is just, O God, quite just.' And these are thoughts and words of earnest repentance, hating itself from the bottom of the heart, and crying out, Shame upon me, what have I done? This pleases God, so that He becomes gracious once more.")<p>But where punishment bears such fruit, God looks upon the sinner with favour again. When Israel had gone so far, He would remember His covenant with the fathers ("My covenant with Jacob," &#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;: the suffix is attached to the governing noun, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-3.htm">Leviticus 6:3</a>, because the noun governed, being a proper name, could not take the suffix), and remember the land (including its inhabitants), which, as is repeated again in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-43.htm">Leviticus 26:43</a>, would be left by them (become desolate) and enjoy its Sabbaths whilst it was waste (depopulated) from (i.e., away from, without) them; and they would enjoy their iniquity, because they had despised the judgments of the Lord, and their soul had rejected His statues. </body></html>
