The stress laid upon this part of the enactment is indicated by the employment here of two verbs of the same import. If he who vows does change the one he dedicated to the Lord, both the animals, the one he originally vowed and the one he substituted for it, are alike holy, and must be delivered to the sanctuary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-10.htm" title="He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.">Leviticus 27:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">He shall not alter it, nor change it — </span>Two words expressing the same thing more emphatically; that is, he shall in no wise change it, neither for one of the same nor of another kind: partly because God would preserve the sanctity and reverence of consecrated things, and therefore would not have them alienated; and partly to prevent abuses of them by those who on this pretence might exchange what had been vowed for the worse. <span class="ital">It and the exchange — </span>That is, both the thing first vowed, and the thing offered and given in exchange.

Some persons who thus dedicated themselves might be employed as assistants; in general they were to be redeemed for a value. It is good to be zealously affected and liberally disposed for the Lord's service; but the matter should be well weighed, and prudence should direct as to what we do; else rash vows and hesitation in doing them will dishonour God, and trouble our own minds.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If he be poorer than thy estimation - Too poor (to pay) thy valuation.

Some think these two words signify the same, but Abarbinel (s) makes them different; according to him, to "alter" is for one of another kind, as one of the herd for one of the flock, or the contrary; and to "change" for one of the same kind: <p>a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; or, as the Targum of Jonathan,"that which is perfect for that which has a blemish in it, or what has a blemish in it for that which is perfect;''a change might not be made neither for the better nor for the worse, but the creature devoted was to be taken as it was; if not fit for sacrifice it was to be sold, and its price put to other uses; for, as Abarbinel (t) observes, whatsoever was devoted to sacred use was never to be put to any profane one; and this was also to teach men not to be hasty and fickle in such things, but to consider well what they did, and abide by it; for if such alterations and changes could be admitted of, a man after he had vowed might through covetousness repent, and bring a bad one instead of a good one, or, under pretence of bringing a good one instead of a bad one, might bring a bad one and say it was good, as Bechai (u) observes; even one worse than he had brought, thinking to impose upon the ignorance of the priest; and indeed if he was sincere in it, and had a mind to bring a better than what he had vowed, it was not allowed of; if he made any change, though it was for the better, he was to be beaten, as Maimonides (w) affirms: <p>and if he shall at all change beast for beast; whether of the same or of a different kind, or whether for better or worse: <p>then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy: both of them were to be the Lord's, and appropriated to sacred use, of one sort or another, either for sacrifice or for the priests family, or the price of it for the repairs of the sanctuary. <p>(s) Apud Muis. in loc.

The words &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1498;, "according to thy (Moses') valuation," it is more simple to regard as an apodosis, so as to supply to &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; the substantive verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, than as a fuller description of the protasis, in which case the apodosis would follow in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-3.htm">Leviticus 27:3</a>, and the verb &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; would have to be supplied. But whatever may be the conclusion adopted, in any case this thought is expressed in the words, that souls, i.e., persons, were to be vowed to the Lord according to Moses' valuation, i.e., according to the price fixed by Moses. This implies clearly enough, that whenever a person was vowed, redemption was to follow according to the valuation. Otherwise what was the object of valuing them? Valuation supposes either redemption or purchase. But in the case of men (i.e., Israelites) there could be no purchasing as slaves, and therefore the object of the valuing could only have been for the purpose of redeeming, buying off the person vowed to the Lord, and the fulfilment of the vow could only have consisted in the payment into the sanctuary of the price fixed by the law.<p>(Note: Saalschtz adopts this explanation in common with the Mishnah. Oehler is wrong in citing <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-11.htm">1 Samuel 2:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-22.htm">1 Samuel 2:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-28.htm">1 Samuel 2:28</a> as a proof of the opposite. For the dedication of Samuel did not consist of a simple vow, but was a dedication as a Nazarite for the whole of his life, and Samuel was thereby vowed to service at the sanctuary, whereas the law says nothing about attachment to the sanctuary in the case of the simple vowing of persons. But because redemption in the case of persons was not left to the pleasure or free-will of the person making the vow as in the case of material property, no addition is made to the valuation price as though for a merely possible circumstance.)</body></html>
