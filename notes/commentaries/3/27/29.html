Like the cattle and the patrimonial estates, when once devoted to God by a vow of banning, the man thus banned by a vow comes irretrievably under the class of “most holy unto the Lord,” or one irrevocably withdrawn from the power of man.<p><span class= "bld">But shall surely be put to death.</span>—Not as a sacrifice to God, but, on the contrary, to be removed out of His sight. This is the apparent import of the passage, and seems to be confirmed by the melancholy narrative of Jephtha and his daughter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-30.htm" title="And Jephthah vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If you shall without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,">Judges 11:30</a>). This seems to have been the interpretation put on the law in question during the second Temple, since it is embodied in the Chaldee Versions, which render the verse as follows: “Every vow that shall be vowed of man, shall not be redeemed with money, but with burnt offerings and with hallowed victims, and with supplications for mercy before the Lord, because such are to be put to death.” It is, however, supposed that this Awful vow of banning could only be exercised on notorious malefactors and idolaters as dangerous to the faith of the Israelites, that it could not be made by any private individual on his own responsibility, and that when such cases occurred the community or the Sanhedrin carried out the ban as an act of judicial necessity, thus showing it to be “most holy unto the Lord.” Accordingly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/27-28.htm" title="Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he has, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:28-29</a> treat of two different cases. The former regulates objects “banned unto the Lord,” which differs from the vow of dedication discussed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/27-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by your estimation.">Leviticus 27:2-8</a> only in so far that it is unredeemable, whilst <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-29.htm" title="None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.">Leviticus 27:29</a> regulates the banning enacted by the law itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-19.htm" title="Whoever lies with a beast shall surely be put to death.">Exodus 22:19</a>), or pronounced by the court of justice on a man who is irretrievably to be put to death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-29.htm" title="None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.">Leviticus 27:29</a></span>. <span class="ital">Devoted of men </span>— Not <span class="ital">by men, </span>as some would elude it, but <span class="ital">of men, </span>for it is manifest both from this and the foregoing verses, that <span class="ital">men </span>are here not the persons devoting, but devoted to destruction, either by God’s sentence, as idolaters, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-20.htm" title="He that sacrifices to any god, save to the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.">Exodus 22:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-15.htm" title="You shall not deliver to his master the servant which is escaped from his master to you:">Deuteronomy 23:15</a>; the Canaanites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-17.htm" title="But you shall utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD your God has commanded you:">Deuteronomy 20:17</a>; the Amalekites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-19.htm" title="And the land shall yield her fruit, and you shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.">Leviticus 25:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-3.htm" title="Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.">1 Samuel 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-26.htm" title="And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you: for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel.">1 Samuel 15:26</a>; Benhadad, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-42.htm" title="And he said to him, Thus said the LORD, Because you have let go out of your hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.">1 Kings 20:42</a>; or by men, in pursuance of such a sentence of God, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/21-2.htm" title="And Israel vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities....">Numbers 21:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-17.htm" title="Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that has known man by lying with him.">Numbers 31:17</a>; or for any crime of a high nature, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-5.htm" title="And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation to the LORD?

But this is certainly not to be understood, as some have taken it, as if a Jew might, by virtue of this text, devote his child or his servant to the Lord, and thereby oblige himself to put them to death. For this is expressly limited to <span class="ital">all that </span>a man <span class="ital">hath </span>or <span class="ital">which is his; </span>that is, which he hath a power over.

But for the Canaanites, Amalekites, &c., God, the undoubted Lord of all men’s lives, gave to the Israelites a power over their persons and lives, and a command to put them to death. And this verse may have a special respect to them, or such as them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:26-33 Things or persons devoted, are distinguished from things or persons that were only sanctified. Devoted things were most holy to the Lord, and could neither be taken back nor applied to other purposes. Whatever productions they had the benefit, God must be honoured with the tenth of, if it could be applied. Thus they acknowledge God to be the Owner of their land, the Giver of its fruits, and themselves to be his tenants, and dependants upon him. Thus they gave him thanks for the plenty they enjoyed, and besought his favour in the continuance of it. We are taught to honour the Lord with our substance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Devoted thing - The primary meaning of the Heb. word &#1495;&#1512;&#1501;  che&#772;rem is something cut off, or shut up. Its specific meaning in the Law is, that which is cut off from common use and given up in some sense to Yahweh, without the right of recal or commutation. It is applied to a field wholly appropriated to the sanctuary <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-21.htm">Leviticus 27:21</a>, and to whatever was doomed to destruction <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-21.htm">1 Samuel 15:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a>. Our translators have often rendered the word by "cursed," or "a curse," which in some places may convey the right sense, but it should be remembered that the terms are not identical in their compass of meaning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-26.htm">Deuteronomy 7:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-28.htm">Isaiah 43:28</a>, etc. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>).<p>Of man and beast - This passage does not permit human sacrifices. Man is elsewhere clearly recognized as one of the creatures which were not to be offered in sacrifice <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-13.htm">Exodus 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-20.htm">Exodus 34:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-15.htm">Numbers 18:15</a>.<p>Therefore the application of the word &#1495;&#1512;&#1501;  che&#772;rem to man is made exclusively in reference to one rightly doomed to death and, in that sense alone, given up to Yahweh. The man who, in a right spirit, either carries out a sentence of just doom on an offender, or who, with a single eye to duty, slays an enemy in battle, must regard himself as God's servant rendering up a life to the claim of the divine justice (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>). It was in this way that Israel was required to destroy the Canaanites at Hormah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-2.htm">Numbers 21:2-3</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12-18</a>), and that Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-33.htm">1 Samuel 15:33</a>. In all such instances, a moral obligation rests upon him whose office it is to take the life: he has to look upon the object of his stroke as under a ban to the Lord (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>). Therefore, there can be neither redemption nor commutation.<p>It is evident that the righteousness of this law is not involved in the sin of rash or foolish vows, such as Saul's <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24</a> or Jephthah's <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-30.htm">Judges 11:30</a>.<p>And it seems hardly needful to add that sacrifice, as it is represented both in the Law and in the usage of the patriarchs, is something very different from consecration under a ban, though a tiring to be sacrificed might come under the designation of &#1495;&#1512;&#1501;  che&#772;rem in its wider sense. The sacrifice was always the offering up of the innocent life of a creature chosen, approved, and without spot or blemish. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. shall surely be put to death&#8212;This announcement imported not that the person was to be sacrificed or doomed to a violent death; but only that he should remain till death unalterably in the devoted condition.

But this is not to be generally understood, as some have taken it, as if a Jew might by virtue of this text devote his child or his servant to the Lord, and thereby oblige himself to put them to death, which peradventure was Jephthah’s error. For this is expressly limited <span class="ital">to all that a man hath, or which is his</span>, i.e. which he hath a power over. But the Jews had no power over the lives of their children or servants, but were directly forbidden to take them away, by that great command, <span class="ital">Thou shalt do no murder</span>.

But for the Canaanites, Amalekites, &c., God, the undoubted Lord of all men’s lives, gave to the Israelites a power over their persons and lives, and a command to put them to death. And this verse may have a special respect to them, or such as them. And although the general subject of this and the former verse be one and the same, yet there are two remarkable differences to this purpose: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The verb is active <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-28.htm" title="Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he has, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:28</a></span>, and the agent there expressed, <span class="ital">that a man shall devote</span>; but it is passive <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-29.htm" title="None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.">Leviticus 27:29</a></span>, and the agent undetermined, <span class="ital">which shall be devoted</span>, to wit, by God, or men in conformity to God’s revealed will. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The devoted person or thing is only to be sold or redeemed, and said to be most holy, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-28.htm" title="Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he has, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:28</a></span>; but here it is to be put to death, and this belongs only to men, and those such as either were or should be devoted in manner now expressed. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed,.... This is said, not of such men as are devoted to the Lord, as in the preceding verse; for it is not said here as there, "none devoted unto the Lord", but of such as are devoted to ruin and destruction, for whom there was no redemption, but they must die; nor is it said, "which is devoted by men, but of men", or from among men; whether they be devoted by God himself, as all idolaters, and particularly the seven nations of the land of Canaan, and especially the Amalekites, who therefore were not to be spared on any account, but to be put to death, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-20.htm">Exodus 22:20</a>. So in the Talmud (o), this is interpreted of Canaanitish servants and handmaids; or whether devoted by men to destruction, either by the people of Israel, as their avowed enemies they should take in war, whom, and their cities, they vowed to the Lord they would utterly destroy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-2.htm">Numbers 21:2</a>; and of such Aben Ezra interprets the words of the text; or such as were doomed by the civil magistrates to die for capital crimes, by stoning, burning, strangling, and slaying with the sword. And this sense is given into by many; because the judges kill with many kinds of death, therefore, says Chaskuni, it is said "every devoted thing", as if he should say, with whatsoever of the four kinds of death the judges pass sentence of destruction on a man, he must die that death; so Jarchi and Ben Melech interpret it of such as go out to be slain, i.e. by the decree of the judges; and if one says, his estimation, or the price of him be upon me, he says nothing, it is of no avail: <p>but shall surely be put to death; as the same writer observes, lo, he goes forth to die, he shall not be redeemed, neither by price nor estimation. The Targum of Jonathan is,"he shall not he redeemed with silver, but with burnt offerings, and holy sacrifices, and petitions of mercy, because he is condemned by a sentence to be slain.''And of either, or of all of these, may the words be understood, and not as they are by some, as if Jewish parents and masters had such a power over their children and servants to devote them to death, or in such a manner devote them, that they were obliged to put them to death; for though they had power in some cases to sell, yet had no power over their lives to take them away, or to devote them to death, which would be a breach of the sixth command, and punishable with death; even a master that accidentally killed his servant did not escape punishment; nay, if he did him any injury, by smiting out an eye, or a tooth, he was obliged to give him his freedom, and much less had he power to take away his life, or devote him to destruction. Some have thought, that it was through a mistaken sense of this law, that Jephthah having made a rash vow sacrificed his daughter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-30.htm">Judges 11:30</a>; but it is a question whether he did or not. <p>(o) T.

This regulation warrants the conclusion, that on the dedication of hereditary fields, the amount was not paid all at once, but year by year.
