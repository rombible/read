The term meat was, and still is, properly given to any kind of provision, and the greater part of this offering was to be eaten for food, not burned. These meat-offerings are mentioned after the burnt-offerings: without an interest in the sacrifice of Christ, and devotedness of heart to God, such services cannot be accepted. Leaven is the emblem of pride, malice, and hypocrisy, and honey of sensual pleasure. The former are directly opposed to the graces of humility, love, and sincerity, which God approves; the latter takes men from the exercises of devotion, and the practice of good works. Christ, in his character and sacrifice, was wholly free from the things denoted by leaven; and his suffering life and agonizing death were the very opposites to worldly pleasure. His people are called to follow, and to be like him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A thing most holy - literally, a holy of holies. All offerings were holy, including the portions of the peace-offerings which were eaten by the laity; but that was "most holy" of which every part was devoted either to the altar, or to the use of the priests. Such were the minchaahs, the showbread, the incense, and the flesh of the sin-offerings and trespass-offerings. Compare the similar distinction between places <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33</a>.

The meat offerings must have gone far to supply the priests with farinaceous food, as, for every handful of flour burnt on the altar, nearly a gallon went to the priests. They had to eat it within the precincts of the tabernacle, as was the case with all meats that were <span class="accented">most holy</span>, viz. the minchahs, the shew-bread, and the flesh of the sin offering and of the trespass offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-12.htm">Leviticus 10:12</a>). Other meats assigned to the priests might be eaten in any clean place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-14.htm">Leviticus 10:14</a>). The priests' own meat offerings were wholly burnt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-23.htm">Leviticus 6:23</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The burnt-offering of fowls was to consist of turtle-doves or young pigeons. The Israelites have reared pigeons and kept dovecots from time immemorial (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-8.htm">Isaiah 60:8</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-25.htm">2 Kings 6:25</a>); and the rearing of pigeons continued to be a favourite pursuit with the later Jews (Josephus, de bell. jud. v. 4, 4), so that they might very well be reckoned among the domesticated animals. There are also turtle-doves and wild pigeons in Palestine in such abundance, that they could easily furnish the ordinary animal food of the poorer classes, and serve as sacrifices in the place of the larger animals. The directions for sacrificing these, were that the priest was to bring the bird to the altar, to hip off its head, and cause it to ascend in smoke upon the altar. &#1502;&#1500;&#1511;, which only occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-15.htm">Leviticus 1:15</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-8.htm">Leviticus 5:8</a>, signifies undoubtedly to pinch off, and not merely to pinch; for otherwise the words in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-8.htm">Leviticus 5:8</a>, "and shall not divide it asunder," would be superfluous. We have therefore to think of it as a severance of the head, as the lxx (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;) and Rabbins have done, and not merely a wringing of the neck and incision in the skin by which the head was left hanging to the body; partly because the words, "and not divide it asunder," are wanting here, and partly also because of the words, "and burn it upon the altar," which immediately follow, and which must refer to the head, and can only mean that, after the head had been pinched off, it was to be put at once into the burning altar-fire. For it is obviously unnatural to regard these words as anticipatory, and refer them to the burning of the whole dove; not only from the construction itself, but still more on account of the clause which follows: "and the blood thereof shall be pressed out against the wall of the altar." The small quantity that there was of the blood prevented it from being caught in a vessel, and swung from it against the altar. </body></html>
