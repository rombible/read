The large thin cakes, and the thin wafer bread, are laid upon the convex surface, where they are baked in comparatively few minutes. These baking operations took place in the court of the sanctuary, where the vessels of ministration were kept (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-20.htm" title="Then said he to me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people.">Ezekiel 46:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/23-28.htm" title="Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;">1Chronicles 23:28-29</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-11 Meat-offerings may typify Christ, as presented to God for us, and as being the Bread of life to our souls; but they rather seem to denote our obligation to God for the blessings of providence, and those good works which are acceptable to God. The term meat was, and still is, properly given to any kind of provision, and the greater part of this offering was to be eaten for food, not burned. These meat-offerings are mentioned after the burnt-offerings: without an interest in the sacrifice of Christ, and devotedness of heart to God, such services cannot be accepted. Leaven is the emblem of pride, malice, and hypocrisy, and honey of sensual pleasure. The former are directly opposed to the graces of humility, love, and sincerity, which God approves; the latter takes men from the exercises of devotion, and the practice of good works. Christ, in his character and sacrifice, was wholly free from the things denoted by leaven; and his suffering life and agonizing death were the very opposites to worldly pleasure. His people are called to follow, and to be like him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A pan - Rather, as in the margin, a flat plate.

The lxx, on the contrary, render it &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;, and this rendering is followed by Luther (and the English Version, Tr.), "its crop with its feathers." But the Hebrew for this would have been &#1493;&#1504;&#1510;&#1514;&#1493;. In Mishnah, Sebach. vi. 5, the instructions are the following: "et removet ingluviem et pennas et viscera egredentia cum illa." This interpretation may be substantially correct, although the reference of &#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1510;&#1514;&#1492; to the feathers of the pigeon cannot be sustained on the ground assigned. For if the bird's crop was taken out, the intestines with their contents would unquestionably come out along with it. The plucking off of the feathers, however, follows from the analogy of the flaying of the animal. Only, in the text neither intestines nor feathers are mentioned; they are passed over as subordinate matters, that could readily be understood from the analogy of the other instructions.)<p>and threw it "at the side of the altar eastwards," i.e., on the eastern side of the altar, "on the ash-place," where the ashes were thrown when taken from the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-3.htm">Leviticus 6:3</a>). He then made an incision in the wings of the pigeon, but without severing them, and burned them on the altar-fire (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-17.htm">Leviticus 1:17</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>).<p>The burnt-offerings all culminated in the presentation of the whole sacrifice upon the altar, that it might ascend to heaven, transformed into smoke and fragrance. Hence it is not only called &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, the ascending (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>), but &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;, a whole-offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-21.htm">Psalm 51:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9</a>). If the burning and sending up in the altar-fire shadowed forth the self-surrender of the offerer to the purifying fire of the Holy Ghost; the burnt-offering was an embodiment of the idea of the consecration and self-surrender of the whole man to the Lord, to be pervaded by the refining and sanctifying power of divine grace. This self-surrender was to be vigorous and energetic in its character; and this was embodied in the instructions to choose male animals for the burnt-offering, the male sex being stronger and more vigorous than the female. To render the self-sacrifice perfect, it was necessary that the offerer should spiritually die, and that through the mediator of his salvation he should put his soul into a living fellowship with the Lord by sinking it as it were into the death of the sacrifice that had died for him, and should also bring his bodily members within the operations of the gracious Spirit of God, that thus he might be renewed and sanctified both body and soul, and enter into union with God. </body></html>
