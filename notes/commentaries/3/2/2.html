The term meat was, and still is, properly given to any kind of provision, and the greater part of this offering was to be eaten for food, not burned. These meat-offerings are mentioned after the burnt-offerings: without an interest in the sacrifice of Christ, and devotedness of heart to God, such services cannot be accepted. Leaven is the emblem of pride, malice, and hypocrisy, and honey of sensual pleasure. The former are directly opposed to the graces of humility, love, and sincerity, which God approves; the latter takes men from the exercises of devotion, and the practice of good works. Christ, in his character and sacrifice, was wholly free from the things denoted by leaven; and his suffering life and agonizing death were the very opposites to worldly pleasure. His people are called to follow, and to be like him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Better: "And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons, the priests; and the (officiating) priest shall take from it," etc.<p>Memorial - The regular name not only for the portion of the &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;  m&#305;&#770;ncha&#772;h which was burned on the altar <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-9.htm">Leviticus 2:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-16.htm">Leviticus 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-12.htm">Leviticus 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-15.htm">Leviticus 6:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/5-26.htm">Numbers 5:26</a>, but for the frankincense which was laid upon the showbread <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-7.htm">Leviticus 24:7</a>.

And this is all that he did with it; he left it with the priest, who carried it to the altar, to the southwest horn of it (b): the order of bringing it, according to Maimonides (c), was this,"a man brings fine flour from his house in baskets of silver or of gold or of other kind of metals, in a vessel fit to be a ministering vessel; and if it is a meat offering of fine flour, he puts it into a ministering vessel, and sanctifies it in a ministering vessel;''then did what follows: <p>and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof; as mixed together: the Jews say (d), this was done with the right hand, which is very likely, that being generally used in this way: the Talmudists thus describe the manner in which the handful was taken; the priest stretched out his three fingers over the palm of his hand, and gathered the handful in the plate or pan, and parted it off with his thumb above, and with his little finger below; and this was the most difficult piece of service in the sanctuary (e): though Maimonides (f) rejects this notion of difficulty, and says it was done in the common way, in which men take up a handful of anything: but Bartenora says (g), it was not in the usual way, but much as before described: the priest put the sides of his fingers into the flour, and gathered the flour with the sides of his fingers within his hand, and took of the flour only three fingers' full, upon the palm of his hand, and no more; and that it might not be heaped or go out, he pared it off, above with his thumb, and below with his little finger; and this he affirms, according to the Gemara, and what his masters had taught him, was one of the hardest pieces of service in the sanctuary: <p>with all the frankincense thereof; this was not taken along with the handful of flour and oil; for if there was ever so small a quantity of frankincense in the handful it was not right (h); for the frankincense, when brought, was put on one side of the fine flour, and when the handful was taken, then that was taken altogether, and put upon it: <p>and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar: that is, he was to burn the handful of fine flour and oil with the frankincense, as a "memorial"; either to put the Lord in mind of his lovingkindness to his people, and of his covenant with them, and promises unto them, to which the allusion is, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-3.htm">Psalm 20:3</a> or to put the offerer in mind of the great sacrifice of Christ, who was to be offered for his sins, and to be a meat offering to him: this was the part the Lord had in this offering, and which related to his worship, as the word used sometimes signifies, as De Dieu has observed: <p>to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>. <p>(b) T.

This was the task of the priest. The handful that he took and burnt upon the altar has the technical and significative name of the memorial. It acted as a memorial before God, in the same way as Cornelius's prayers and alms - "Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-4.htm">Acts 10:4</a>) - being something which should cause God to think graciously of the offerer. The frankincense is not mixed with the flour and the oil and the salt, as a constituent element of the offering, but is placed upon them, and is all of it burnt in "the memorial," symbolizing the need of adding prayer to sacrifice, that the latter may be acceptable to God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/leviticus/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With regard to the mode of sacrificing, the instructions already given for the oxen applied to the flock (i.e., to the sheep and goats) as well, so that the leading points are repeated here, together with a more precise description of the place for slaughtering, viz., "by the side of the altar towards the north," i.e., on the north side of the altar. This was the rule with all the slain-offerings; although it is only in connection with the burnt-offerings, sin-offerings, and trespass-offerings (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-24.htm">Leviticus 4:24</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-29.htm">Leviticus 4:29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-33.htm">Leviticus 4:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-18.htm">Leviticus 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-2.htm">Leviticus 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-13.htm">Leviticus 14:13</a>) that it is expressly mentioned, whilst the indefinite expression "at the door (in front) of the tabernacle" is applied to the peace-offerings in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-8.htm">Leviticus 3:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-13.htm">Leviticus 3:13</a>, as it is to the trespass-offerings in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-4.htm">Leviticus 4:4</a>, from which the Rabbins have inferred, though hardly upon good ground, that the peace-offerings could be slaughtered in any part of the court. The northern side of the altar was appointed as the place of slaughtering, however, not from the idea that the Deity dwelt in the north (Ewald), for such an idea is altogether foreign to Mosaism, but, as Knobel supposes, probably because the table of shew-bread, with the continual meat-offering, stood on the north side in the holy place. Moreover, the eastern side of the altar in the court was the place for the refuse, or heap of ashes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-16.htm">Leviticus 1:16</a>); the ascent to the altar was probably on the south side, as Josephus affirms that it was in the second temple (J. de bell. jud. v. 5, 6); and the western side, or the space between the altar and the entrance to the holy place, would unquestionably have been the most unsuitable of all for the slaughtering.
