During the second Temple, the pieces were put into a ministering vessel, oil and frankincense were then put on them, and the vessel was carried by the offerer to the priest, and the priest carried it to the altar and brought it to the south-west.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-11 Meat-offerings may typify Christ, as presented to God for us, and as being the Bread of life to our souls; but they rather seem to denote our obligation to God for the blessings of providence, and those good works which are acceptable to God. The term meat was, and still is, properly given to any kind of provision, and the greater part of this offering was to be eaten for food, not burned. These meat-offerings are mentioned after the burnt-offerings: without an interest in the sacrifice of Christ, and devotedness of heart to God, such services cannot be accepted. Leaven is the emblem of pride, malice, and hypocrisy, and honey of sensual pleasure. The former are directly opposed to the graces of humility, love, and sincerity, which God approves; the latter takes men from the exercises of devotion, and the practice of good works. Christ, in his character and sacrifice, was wholly free from the things denoted by leaven; and his suffering life and agonizing death were the very opposites to worldly pleasure. His people are called to follow, and to be like him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fryingpan - Rather, pan, commonly used for boiling.

Oil only was used in the meat offerings, and probably for a symbolic reason. It is evident that these meat offerings were previously prepared by the offerer, and when brought, the priest was to take it from his hands and burn a portion on the altar.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/leviticus/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/leviticus/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shalt bring the meat offering, that is made of these things, unto the Lord,....

The suffix in &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493; (his offering) refers to &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, which is frequently construed as both masculine and feminine (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-27.htm">Leviticus 4:27-28</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>, etc.), or as masculine only (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-28.htm">Numbers 31:28</a>) in the sense of person, any one. "And let him pour oil upon it, and put incense thereon (or add incense to it)." This was not spread upon the flour, on which oil had been poured, but added in such a way, that it could be lifted from the minchah and burned upon the altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-2.htm">Leviticus 2:2</a>). The priest was then to take a handful of the gift that had been presented, and cause the azcarah of it to evaporate above (together with) all the incense. &#1511;&#1502;&#1510;&#1493; &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;: the filling of his closed hand, i.e., as much as he could hold with his hand full, not merely with three fingers, as the Rabbins affirm. Azcarah (from &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;, formed like &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;) is only applied to Jehovah's portion, which was burned upon the altar in the case of the meat-offering (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-9.htm">Leviticus 2:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-16.htm">Leviticus 2:16</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-8.htm">Leviticus 6:8</a>), the sin-offering of flour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-11.htm">Leviticus 5:11</a>), and the jealousy-offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-26.htm">Numbers 5:26</a>), and to the incense added to the shew-bread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-7.htm">Leviticus 24:7</a>). It does not mean the prize portion, i.e., the portion offered for the glory of God, as De Dieu and Rosenmller maintain, still less the fragrance-offering (Ewald), but the memorial, or remembrance-portion, &#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; or &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-7.htm">Leviticus 24:7</a>, lxx), memoriale (Vulg.), inasmuch as that part of the minchah which was placed upon the altar ascended in the smoke of the fire "on behalf of the giver, as a practical mememto ('remember me') to Jehovah:" though there is no necessity that we should trace the word to the Hiphil in consequence. The rest of the minchah was to belong to Aaron and his sons, i.e., to the priesthood, as a most holy thing of the firings of Jehovah. The term "most holy" is applied to all the sacrificial gifts that were consecrated to Jehovah, in this sense, that such portions as were not burned upon the altar were to be eaten by the priests alone in a holy place; the laity, and even such of the Levites as were not priests, being prohibited from partaking of them (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>). Thus the independent meat-offerings, which were not entirely consumed upon the altar (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-10.htm">Leviticus 2:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-10.htm">Leviticus 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-12.htm">Leviticus 10:12</a>), the sin-offerings and trespass-offerings, the flesh of which was not burned outside the camp (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-18.htm">Leviticus 6:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-22.htm">Leviticus 6:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-1.htm">Leviticus 7:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-6.htm">Leviticus 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-17.htm">Leviticus 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-13.htm">Leviticus 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-9.htm">Numbers 18:9</a>), the shew-bread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-9.htm">Leviticus 24:9</a>), and even objects put under the ban and devoted to the Lord, whether men, cattle, or property of other kinds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-28.htm">Leviticus 27:28</a>), as well as the holy incense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-36.htm">Exodus 30:36</a>), - in fact, all the holy sacrificial gifts, in which there was any fear lest a portion should be perverted to other objects, - were called most holy; whereas the burnt-offerings, the priestly meat-offerings (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-12.htm">Leviticus 6:12-16</a>) and other sacrifices, which were quite as holy, were not called most holy, because the command to burn them entirely precluded the possibility of their being devoted to any of the ordinary purposes of life. </body></html>
