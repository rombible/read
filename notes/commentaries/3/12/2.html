(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/1-11.htm" title="And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth: and it was so.">Genesis 1:11-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-29.htm" title="And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.">Genesis 1:29</a>.) This general statement is afterwards specified by the phrases “and born a man child,” and “bear a maid child,” in the verse before us, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-5.htm" title="But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying three score and six days.">Leviticus 12:5</a>. Thus the regulations about impurity naturally begin with the beginning of life. According to the administrators of the law during the second Temple, the regulations here set forth with regard to the deliverance are in force even when it is an untimely birth, or when the child is born dead, provided it has a perfect shape, which it assumes after forty days of its conception. Amongst the Hindoos, too, the mother in case of a miscarriage remains in a state of defilement as many nights as months have elapsed since her conception.<p><span class= "bld">And born a man child.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">and giveth birth to a male child. </span>The expression rendered here in the Authorised Version by “a man child” is translated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-7.htm" title="Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for her that has born a male or a female.">Leviticus 12:7</a> simply “male.” In so short a paragraph discussing the same enactment it is important that words identical in the original should be translated uniformly in English.<p><span class= "bld">She shall be unclean seven days.</span>—Though the issue of blood which succeeds child-birth generally only lasts three or four days, yet the period of uncleanness is extended to seven days to include exceptional cases.<p><span class= "bld">According to the days . . . . —</span>Better, <span class= "ital">as in the days of the uncleanness of her monthly courses, </span>that is, her uncleanness is to be of the same duration, and she is to observe the same rules, and be subjected to the same restraints as during the period of her menstruation. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-19.htm" title="And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whoever touches her shall be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:19</a>.) The fact that reference is here made to the regulations about the periodical impurity of women which have not as yet been laid down shows that, like other laws, this law was already known to and generally practised by the Jews before it was finally fixed in the Levitical code.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/leviticus/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.">Leviticus 12:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Seven days — </span>Not for any filthiness which was either in the conception, or in bringing forth, but to signify the universal and deep pollution of man’s nature, even from the birth, and from the conception.
