Henderson, similarly, "the captives that are among the Canaanites," &c. But the corresponding clauses of the parallelism are better balanced in English Version, "the ten tribes of Israel shall possess the territory of the Canaanites," namely, Western Palestine and Phœnicia (Jud 3:3).

It was therefore a district of Western Asia Minor, about Lydia, and near the Bosphorus. It is made an appellative by Maurer. "The Jerusalem captives of the dispersion" (compare Jas 1:1), wherever they be dispersed, shall return and possess the southern cities. Sepharad, though literally the district near the Bosphorus, represents the Jews' far and wide dispersion.

That is, the host or army, the great number of the children of Israel, that have been carried captive, upon their return shall possess that part of the land of Israel which was inhabited formerly by the Canaanites, even as far as to Zarephath, said to belong to Zidon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-10.htm">1 Kings 17:10</a>; and called Sarepta of Sidon; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-26.htm">Luke 4:26</a>. It is mentioned by Pliny (h) along with Sidon, where glass was made; and perhaps this place might have its name from the melting of glass in it, from  which signifies to melt metals, glass, &amp;c. it is called by Josephus (i) Sarephtha; who says it was not far from Sidon and Tyre, and lay between them: according to an Arabic geographer (k), it was twenty miles from Tyre, and ten from Sidon. Here the Prophet Elijah dwelt for a time; and in the times of Jerom (l) was shown a little tower, said to be his habitation, which travellers visited. Mr. Maundrell (m) speaks of this place as three hours' journey from Sidon, and is now called <p>"Sarphan, supposed (he says) to be the ancient Sarephath, or Sarepta, so famous for the residence and miracles of the Prophet Elijah; the place shown us for this city consisted of only a few houses on the tops of the mountains, within about half a mile of the sea; but it is more probable the principal part of, the city stood below, in the space between the hills and the sea, there being ruins still to be seen in that place, of a considerable extent?'' <p>It was once a place very famous for wine; the wine of Sarepta is often made mention of by writers (n); perhaps vines might grow upon the hills and mountains about it; and this being a city of Phoenicia, on the northern border of the land of Israel, is very fitly observed as the limit of the possession of the Israelites this way; <p>and the captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south; the Jews, who were carried captive into Babylon, to Sepharad; some place, though unknown, perhaps in the land of Babylon. Calmet (o) conjectures it may be Sippara or Sipparat, in Mesopotamia, a little above the division of the Euphrates: and the Septuagint version renders it Ephratha; which perhaps is a corruption, of the Euphrates in the present copies: the Vulgate Latin version translates it Bosphorus; and so Jerom, who says that the Hebrew that taught him assured him that Bosphorus was called Sepharad; whither Adrian is said to carry the Jews captive. Kimchi and Aben Ezra interpret it of the present captivity of theirs by Titus, who upon their return to their land shall possess the, southern part of it, which originally belonged to the tribe of Judah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-20.htm">Joshua 15:20</a>. If Sepharad, in the Assyrian language, signifies a border, as Jerom says it does, it denotes, as some think, that part of Arabia which borders on the south of Judea, that shall be inhabited by the Jews. Some render the words, "the captivity of Jerusalem shall possess that which is in Sepharad, and the cities of the south": but this is contrary to the accents, unless the words "shall possess" be repeated, and so two clauses made, "the captivity of Jerusalem shall possess that which is in Sepharad; they shall possess the cities of the south". The Targum and Syriac version, instead of Sepharad, have Spain; and so the Jewish writers generally interpret it. By the Canaanites they think are meant the Germans, and the country of Germany; by Zarephath, France; and by Sepharad, Spain; so Aben Ezra, Jarchi, Kimchi, and Ben Melech, fancying that they who are now captives in these countries shall one day possess them: but the prophecy only respects their settlement in their own land, and some parts adjacent to it; or rather the enlargement of the church of Christ in the world. A late learned writer (p), is of opinion that some respect may be had to this passage in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, in which the former makes mention of "five brethren" that he had, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-28.htm">Luke 16:28</a>; and are by the said writer thus reckoned: <p>1. the house of Jacob; 2. the house of Joseph, which are said to possess the south, with the mountains of Esau, and the plain; 3. Benjamin, which shall possess Gilead; 4. the captives from the Assyrian captivity; 5. the captives from the Jerusalem captivity, namely, by Titus Vespasian, who shall possess the cities of the south. <p>(h) Nat.

Two ways of rendering this verse are given in our English Bibles, one in the text, the other in the margin. The latter of these fully expressed would be: “<span class="ital">And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall possess that</span> (i.e. the land) <span class="ital">of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem shall possess that which is in Sepharad; they shall possess the cities of the south</span>.” But a third rendering of the verse is possible and appears to be more satisfactory than either of these:—“<span class="bld">And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel which the Canaanites (have carried captive) even unto Zarephath and the captivity of Jerusalem which is in Sepharad (these) shall possess the cities of the south</span>.” The prophet having assigned their dwelling-place to the main body of the people, the tribes of Judah and Benjamin who returned from Babylon, now bethinks him of their brethren, who in the general disruption of the Chaldean invasion had been carried captive in other directions. He mentions two such bodies of captives, whether as including or as representing all Jews who were in such a case, and for them he finds a home in the regions of the south. Another rendering is adopted in R.V.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">this host of the children of Israel</span>] It is suggested in the Speaker’s <span class="ital">Commentary</span>, that the word “this” here “indicates the body (of exiles) to which Obadiah himself belonged, and of which he formed one. We know nothing,” it is said, “of Obadiah’s history; he may well have been one of the many inhabitants of Judah who had to flee before the Babylonish inroad, and were afterwards spread as homeless exiles through the cities of Palestine and Phœnicia. If this be so, a touching personal interest attaches itself to the prophet’s words. He comforts his brother-exiles in Canaan by telling them that they, as well as the exiles in Sepharad, should return, and take possession of the cities of the south.” The suggestion is interesting, but it is more natural to understand the expression, “this host of the children of Israel,” of the entire body of the Jews, uprooted and doomed to exile as Obadiah saw them when he wrote. Of this whole captive host, he says, that portion which has been carried into Phœnicia shall be thus provided for. In this sense the word “host” (“forces”) is perhaps used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-11.htm" title="In the day that you stood on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots on Jerusalem, even you were as one of them.">Obadiah 1:11</a>. See note there.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">even unto Zarephath</span>] The <span class="ital">Sarepta</span> of the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-26.htm" title="But to none of them was Elias sent, save to Sarepta, a city of Sidon, to a woman that was a widow.">Luke 4:26</a>) famous in the history of Elijah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/17-9.htm" title="Arise, get you to Zarephath, which belongs to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain you....">1 Kings 17:9-24</a>. It was a considerable town, as its ruins now shew, on the coast road between Tyre and Sidon. Its modern representative, Sarafend, is a small village on the hill above.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in Sepharad</span>] Great difference of opinion exists as to the meaning and reference of this word. The conjecture of Jerome that it is not a proper name, but the Assyrian word for “boundary,” which the prophet has adopted, is accepted by some. It would then mean, “who are scattered abroad in all the boundaries and regions of the earth.” Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-1.htm" title="James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.">James 1:1</a>. It is more probable, however, that like Zarephath in the other clause of the verse, Sepharad is the name of a place, though it is not easy to determine what place is intended by it. The modern Jews understand it of Spain, and accordingly, “at the present day the Spanish Jews, who form the chief of the two great sections into which the Jewish nation is divided, are called by the Jews themselves the <span class="ital">Sephardim</span>, German Jews being known as the <span class="ital">Ashkenazim.” Dict. of the Bible</span>, Art. <span class="ital">Sepharad</span>. By others it is identified with Sardis, the capital of the Lydian kingdom, the name having been discovered as it is thought to designate Sardis in the cuneiform Persian inscriptions. Adopting this view (for which some have found support in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-6.htm" title="The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have you sold to the Grecians, that you might remove them far from their border.">Joel 3:6</a>). Dr Pusey thus explains the whole verse: “Zarephath (probably ‘smelting-house,’ and so a place of slave-labour, pronounced Sarepta in St Luke) belonged to Sidon, lying on the sea about half way between it and Tyre. These were then, probably, captives, placed by the Tyrians for the time in safe keeping in the narrow plain between Lebanon and the sea, intercepted by Tyre itself from their home, and awaiting to be transported to a more distant slavery. These, with those already sold to the Grecians and in slavery at Sardis, form one whole. They stand as representatives of all who, whatever their lot, had been rent off from the Lord’s land, and had been outwardly severed from His heritage.” Other conjectures are given in the article in the <span class="ital">Dictionary of the Bible</span>. Whatever uncertainty attaches to the word <span class="ital">Sepharad</span>, the drift of the prophecy is perfectly clear, viz. that not only the exiles from Babylon, but Jewish captives from other and distant regions shall be brought back to live prosperously within the enlarged borders of their own land.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/obadiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "And this shall be the beginning of the captivity of the children of Israel, the land of the Canaanites as far as Sarepta." This would imply that the Ephraimitas should be the first to go into exile, and on their return should occupy the territory of the Canaanites on the north. But <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> may mean "domain." Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et transmigratio exercitus hujus filiorum Israel, omnia loca Chananaeorum usque ad Sareptam.</span> The general meaning is that Jewish captives, who have been taken to other lands, shall return and possess the cities of the south. The sentence in the Hebrew is incomplete. Our translators supply, "shall possess." Pusey (in agreement with the Chaldee, and virtually with the Septuagint) renders, "which are among the Canaanites;" and this seems to be correct, making "shall possess the cities of the south" the predicate of both clauses. So the first portion of the verse means, as Henderson says, the number of Israelitish captives which were found in Phoenicia, into which they had been sold at different times as slaves (comp. vers. 11, 14; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-6.htm">Joel 3:6, 7</a>). <span class="accented">This host.</span> Not a general deportation, but only the portion of the people referred to. From this expression some have inferred that Obadiah himself was one of this body. This is possible, but not necessary. The captives who are among the Canaanites, even <span class="accented">unto Zarephath</span>; <span class="accented">as far as Zarephath</span>, were probably placed there for safe keeping before being sold into Greece and other countries. Zarepbath ("Melting house"), the <span class="accented">Sarepta</span> of St. Luke (Luke 4:26), now <span class="accented">Surafend</span> or <span class="accented">Sarafend</span>, and celebrated in the history of Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-9.htm">1 Kings 17:9</a>, etc.), lay between Tyre and Sidon, a little inland, and was a town of some importance, as its ruins prove.

Jerome suggests, in his commentary, that it is the Assyrian for "boundary," and not a proper name at all. The Peshito and the rabbins And modern Jews interpret it as "Spain." Keil supposes it to be "Sparta;" Pusey, "Sardis." For this last explanation some ground has been found in an inscription of Nakshi-Rustam, where a place called <span class="accented">Cparda</span> occurs in a list of tribes between Cappadocia and Ionia; and <span class="accented">Cparda is</span> considered to be the Persian form of <span class="accented">Sardis</span> (see Schrader, 'Keilinschr.,' p. 445, etc.). A further confirmation of this identification is found in the complaint of Joel (Joel 3:6 [4:6, Hebrew], that the Phoenicians had sold Israelites "unto the sons of the Grecians." Professor Sayce, in a note to G. Smith's 'History of Babylonia,' p. 156, places "Saparda" on the Black Sea. It may be questioned, however, whether some town nearer Judaea is not intended.

"Thus saith Jehovah: for three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I shall not reverse it, because it has burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-2.htm">Amos 2:2</a>. I send fire into Moab, and it will devour the palaces of Kirioth, and Moab will perish in the tumult, in the war-cry, in the trumpet-blast. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-3.htm">Amos 2:3</a>. And I cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and all its princes do I strangle with it, saith Jehovah." The burning of the bones of the king of Edom is not burning while he was still alive, but the burning of the corpse into lime, i.e., so completely that the bones turned into powder like lime (D. Kimchi), to cool his wrath still further upon the dead man (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-16.htm">2 Kings 23:16</a>). This is the only thing blamed, not his having put him to death. No record has been preserved of this event in the historical books of the Old Testament; but it was no doubt connected with the war referred to in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3.htm">2 Kings 3</a>, which Joram of Israel and Jehoshaphat of Judah waged against the Moabites in company with the king of Edom; so that the Jewish tradition found in Jerome, viz., that after this war the Moabites dug up the bones of the king of Edom from the grace, and heaped insults upon them by burning them to ashes, is apparently not without foundation. As Amos in the case of all the other nations has mentioned only crimes that were committed against the covenant nation, the one with which the Moabites are charged must have been in some way associated with either Israel or Judah, that is to say, it must have been committed upon a king of Edom, who was a vassal of Judah, and therefore not very long after this war, since the Edomites shook off their dependence upon Judah in less than ten years from that time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20</a>). As a punishment for this, Moab was to be laid waste by the fire of war, and Keriyoth with its palaces to be burned down. &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is not an appellative noun (&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, lxx), but a proper name of one of the chief cities of Moab (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-24.htm">Jeremiah 48:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-41.htm">Jeremiah 48:41</a>), the ruins of which have been discovered by Burckhardt (Syr. p. 630) and Seetzen (ii. p. 342, cf. iv. p. 384) in the decayed town of Kereyat or Krrit. The application of the term &#1502;&#1514; to Moab is to be explained on the supposition that the nation is personified. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; signifies war tumult, and  &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;  is explained as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-14.htm">Amos 1:14</a> by  &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512;,  blast of the trumpets, the signal for the assault or for the commencement of the battle. The judge with all the princes shall be cut off miqqirba&#770;h, i.e., out of the land of Moab. The feminine suffix refers to Moab as a land or kingdom, and not to Keriyoth. From the fact that the sho&#772;phe&#772;t is mentioned instead of the king, it has been concluded by some that Moab had no king at that time, but had only a sho&#772;phe&#772;t as its ruler; and they have sought to account for this on the ground that Moab was at that time subject to the kingdom of the ten tribes (Hitzig and Ewald). But there is no notice in the history of anything of the kind, and it cannot possibly be inferred from the fact that Jeroboam restored the ancient boundaries of the kingdom as far as the Dead Sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). Sho&#772;phe&#772;t is analogous to to&#772;me&#772;kh she&#772;bhet in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/1-5.htm">Amos 1:5</a>, and is probably nothing more than a rhetorical expression applied to the &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, who is so called in the threat against Ammon, and simply used for the sake of variety. The threatening prophecies concerning all the nations and kingdoms mentioned from <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-6.htm">Amos 1:6</a> onwards were fulfilled by the Chaldeans, who conquered all these kingdoms, and carried the people themselves into captivity.
