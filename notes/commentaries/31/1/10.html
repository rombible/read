Various acts of hostility and treachery towards Israel are specified by the prophet, in a manner to lead to the feeling that though his tone is prohibitory, he is recalling instances of past malignity on Edom’s part, as types of what might be found in the future.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">For thy violence</span> . . .—Literally, <span class= "ital">for injury of thy brother Jacob,</span> &c.; the genitive of the object, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-19.htm" title="Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.">Joel 3:19</a>. The crime was the more heinous because against the brother tribe. Probably the birth-name, Jacob, of the twin brother of Esau is used purposely to bring out the full wickedness of the descendants of Esau. In spite of all provocations, Israel long maintained the duty of a friendly feeling for the kindred race—maintained it as a religious duty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-5.htm" title="Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir to Esau for a possession.">Deuteronomy 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-7.htm" title="You shall not abhor an Edomite; for he is your brother: you shall not abhor an Egyptian; because you were a stranger in his land.">Deuteronomy 23:7</a>). On the other hand, Edom from the first assumed a jealous and hostile attitude (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-14.htm" title="And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus said your brother Israel, You know all the travail that has befallen us:">Numbers 20:14</a>, <span class= "ital">seqq.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> never imitating the generous disposition of their great ancestor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-4.htm" title="And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.">Genesis 33:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Shame shall cover thee.</span>—Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-10.htm" title="Then she that is my enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said to me, Where is the LORD your God? my eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.">Micah 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-25.htm" title="We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covers us: for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.">Jeremiah 3:25</a>.<p>(11) <span class= "bld">In the day</span> . . .—Literally, <span class= "ital">In the day of thy standing over against,</span> as if to particularise some one occasion; but instead of proceeding to state it, the prophet recalls other events of the same time, and sums up Edom’s offence in the charge, “thou, too, as one of them,” acting the part of an enemy instead of that of a friend, though probably in the base character of a neutral (comp. “My lovers and my friends stand <span class= "ital">aloof</span> from my sore,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-11.htm" title="My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.">Psalm 38:11</a>), ready to take the winning side.<p><span class= "bld">Forces.—</span>It is difficult to choose between this and the marginal reading, <span class= "ital">substance. Shâvah</span> is usually “to take prisoner,” but there are many instances of its use in the sense of carrying off booty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-21.htm" title="And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand.">1Chronicles 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-17.htm" title="And they came up into Judah, and broke into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.">2Chronicles 21:17</a>, where see marg., and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-14.htm" title="And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came on them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.">2Chronicles 14:14</a>). And <span class= "ital">chayil,</span> whose root-meaning is strength, while often meaning <span class= "ital">forces,</span> has eleven times the meaning <span class= "ital">riches</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-4.htm" title="For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.">Isaiah 8:4</a>, &c.), and eight times <span class= "ital">substance</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-5.htm" title="Whose harvest the hungry eats up, and takes it even out of the thorns, and the robber swallows up their substance.">Job 5:5</a>, &c.).<p>The three clauses in this verse form a climax:—(1) The plunder of the open country; (2) entry into the gates of the cities; (3) casting lots for the spoil in the very capital itself. It is natural to regard this latter event as identical with that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-3.htm" title="And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.">Joel 3:3</a>, the final destruction of Jerusalem and dispersion of its inhabitants into captivity. But for the question of the event intended and its connection with the date of the prophecy, see Excursus.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">Thou shouldest not . . .</span>—Here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/obadiah/1-13.htm" title="You should not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yes, you should not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;">Obadiah 1:13-14</a>, correctly as in marg., <span class= "ital">Do not, &c. Al</span> with the apoc. pres. or fut. must be prohibitory. Calasio’s Concordance supplies 207 instances (see Pusey’s note). But the warning against these particular offences undoubtedly springs from the reminiscence of such conduct in former times. The passage is neither definitely historical nor definitely prophetic. What has happened in the past becomes a type of what will happen in the future.

The word is repeated with the same sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-13.htm" title="You should not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yes, you should not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;">Obadiah 1:13</a>. Pusey remarks: “Malicious gazing on human calamity, forgetful of man’s common origin and common liability to ill, is the worst form of human hate. It was one of the contumelies of the Cross.”<p><span class= "bld">In the day that he became a stranger.—</span>Literally, <span class= "ital">in the day of his strangeness.</span> The form <span class= "ital">nokher</span> is only found here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-3.htm" title="Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?">Job 31:3</a> (<span class= "ital">nekher</span>) with different pointing, where it is translated “strange punishment.” The adjective <span class= "ital">nokhri,</span> also, has always the sense of <span class= "ital">strange,</span> though the root-verb seems to have the signification <span class= "ital">to recognise.</span> From <span class= "ital">to recognise an apparent stranger</span> to <span class= "ital">treat as a stranger</span> (which the derived conjugations, that alone are used, sometimes mean) is a natural transition. Perhaps here, “unheard of calamity.”<p><span class= "bld">Spoken proudly.</span>—Literally, as in marg., <span class= "ital">made thy mouth great</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-21.htm" title="Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye has seen it.">Psalm 35:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-4.htm" title="Against whom do you sport yourselves? against whom make you a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are you not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood.">Isaiah 57:4</a>). The mention of <span class= "ital">grimaces</span> adds to the graphic character of the picture. Again we are reminded of the wanton and savage insolence around the Cross.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">The day of their calamity.—</span>Thrice repeated, to bring into prominence the malignity of Edom’s conduct. The same expression used by Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-5.htm" title="Because you have had a perpetual hatred, and have shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end:">Ezekiel 35:5</a>), in the same connection, probably with reference to the same occasion.<p><span class= "bld">Calamity.</span>—Heb., <span class= "ital">êyd.</span> Variously derived and explained, either as <span class= "ital">load of trouble</span> or <span class= "ital">dark gloomy time.</span><p>(14) <span class= "bld">Crossway.—</span>Heb., <span class= "ital">perek</span> = separated (English, <span class= "ital">fork</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> It only occurs here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-1.htm" title="Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery; the prey departs not;">Nahum 3:1</a>, where it is translated <span class= "ital">robbery</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> that which is torn or divided.

But probably it had become a recognised prophetic expression long before it was committed to writing. The primary meaning is not the day of judgment, but the day on which Jehovah reveals His majesty and omnipotence in a glorious manner, to overthrow all ungodly powers and to complete His kingdom. As the misfortunes of Israel increased, and the hostility of surrounding nations gathered to a successful head, it was natural that the idea of retribution upon them for their violence to the chosen race should usurp the prominent place in prophecy. The “day of Jehovah” became the day of Jehovah’s <span class= "ital">wrath</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-18.htm" title="Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.">Zephaniah 1:18</a>) and Jehovah’s <span class= "ital">vengeance</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-8.htm" title="For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion.">Isaiah 34:8</a>). The fading of the temporal hopes implied in the expression naturally led to its higher religious use; and the various phrases for the same idea—“the day,” “the great day,” “the day of judgment,” “the last day”—passed first into Jewish, and afterwards into Christian, eschatology, taking with them all the prophetic imagery which painted the expectancy of Israel: imagery of the splendour of victory and triumph on the one side, of terrible overthrow and slaughter on the other, but rich as well with its infinite spiritual suggestiveness.<p><span class= "bld">As thou hast done</span> . . .—For this stern announcement of the <span class= "ital">lex talionis</span> on the offending nation, comp.

But who are addressed, the people of Jerusalem or the Edomites? The question is perplexed. If we keep the tropical sense of <span class= "ital">drink</span> in both clauses, which is the most natural way, understanding by it the cup of suffering, since it is said to have been drunk on Mount Zion, it must have been drained by Israelites, as Ewald and others take the passage. On the other hand, it seems awkward to make the prophet turn from addressing Edom to Judah, not else addressed in his prophecy. If taken in a literal sense, the drinking on Mount Zion would, of course, refer to the carousing and revelry which always followed heathen victory, and sometimes with terrible aggravation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-3.htm" title="And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.">Joel 3:3</a>). Taking the passage in this sense, we must understand the prophet to take Edom as a type of all heathen in their attitude towards Israel, so that what he says of one nation applies to all. But it is quite possible that our text embodies an old oracular saying addressed to Israel. This is Ewald’s view.<p><span class= "bld">Swallow down.</span>—Margin, <span class= "ital">sup up.</span> The substantive <span class= "ital">loa’</span> signifies a throat.

Its destruction seems to have been typical, as their father Esau's rejection; and to refer to the destruction of the enemies of the gospel church. See the prediction of the success of that war; Edom shall be spoiled, and brought down. All the enemies of God's church shall be disappointed in the things they stay themselves on. God can easily lay those low who magnify and exalt themselves; and will do it. Carnal security ripens men for ruin, and makes the ruin worse when it comes. Treasures on earth cannot be so safely laid up but that thieves may break through and steal; it is therefore our wisdom to lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven. Those that make flesh their trust, arm it against themselves. The God of our covenant will never deceive us: but if we trust men with whom we join ourselves, it may prove to us a wound and dishonour. God will justly deny those understanding to keep out of danger, who will not use their understandings to keep out of sin. All violence, all unrighteousness, is sin; but it makes the violence far worse, if it be done against any of God's people. Their barbarous conduct towards Judah and Jerusalem, is charged upon them. In reflecting on ourselves, it is good to consider what we should have done; to compare our practice with the Scripture rule. Sin, thus looked upon in the glass of the commandment, will appear exceedingly sinful. Those have a great deal to answer for, who are idle spectators of the troubles of their neighbours, when able to be active helpers. Those make themselves poor, who think to make themselves rich by the ruin of the people of God; and those deceive themselves, who call all that their own on which they can lay their hands in a day of calamity. Though judgment begins at the house of God, it shall not end there. Let sorrowful believers and insolent oppressors know, that the troubles of the righteous will soon end, but those of the wicked will be eternal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/obadiah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For thy violence against thy brother Jacob - To Israel God had commanded: (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-7.htm">Deuteronomy 23:7-8</a> (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-8.htm">Deuteronomy 23:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-9.htm">Deuteronomy 23:9</a> in the Hebrew text)), "Thou shalt not abbor an Edomite, for he is thy brother. The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the Lord in their third generation." Edom did the contrary to all this. "Violence" includes all sorts of ill treatment, from one with whom "might is right," "because it is in the power of their hand" <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a>. to do it. This they had done to the descendants of their brother, and him, their twin brother, Jacob. They helped the Chaldaeans in his overthrow, rejoiced in his calamity, thought that, by this cooperation, they had secured themselves. What, when from those same Chaldees, those same calamities, which they had aided to inflict on their brother, came on themselves, when, as they had betrayed him, they were themselves betrayed; as they had exulted in his overthrow, so their allies exulted in their's! The "shame" of which the prophet spoke, is not the healthful distress at the evil of sin, but at its evils and disappointments. Shame at the evil which sin is, works repentance and turns aside the anger of God. Shame at the evils which sin brings, in itself leads to further sins, and endless, fruitless, shame. Edom had laid his plans, had succeeded; the wheel, in God's Providence, turned around and he was crushed.<p>So Hosea said <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/10-6.htm">Hosea 10:6</a>, "they shall be ashamed through their own counsels;" and Jeremiah Jer 3:25, "we lie down in our shame and our confusion covereth us;" and David <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-29.htm">Psalm 109:29</a>, "let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion as with a mantle." As one, covered and involved in a cloak, can find no way to emerge; as one, whom the waters cover <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-10.htm">Exodus 15:10</a>, is buried under them inextricably, so, wherever they went, whatever they did, shame covered them. So the lost shall "rise to shame and everlasting contempt" <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>.<p>Thou shalt be cut off forever - One word expressed the sin, "violence;" four words, over against it, express the sentence; shame encompassing, everlasting excision. God's sentences are not completed at once in this life. The branches are lopped off; the tree decays; the axe is laid to the root; at last it is cut down. As the sentence on Adam, "in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die," was fulfilled, although Adam did not die, until he had completed 930 years <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/5-5.htm">Genesis 5:5</a>, so was this on Edom, although fulfilled in stages and by degrees. Adam bore the sentence of death about him. The 930 years wore out at last that frame, which, but for sin, had been immortal. So Edom received this sentence of excision, which was, on his final impenitence, completed, although centuries witnessed the first earnest only of its execution. Judah and Edom stood over against each other, Edom ever bent on the extirpation of Judah. At that first destruction of Jerusalem, Edom triumphed, "Raze her! Raze her, even to the ground!" Yet, though it tarried long, the sentence was fulfilled. Judah, the banished, survived; Edom, the triumphant, was, in God's time and after repeated trials, "cut off forever." Do we marvel at the slowness of God's sentence? Rather, marvel we, with wondering thankfulness, that His sentences, on nations or individuals, are slow, yet, stand we in awe, because, if unrepealed, they are sure. Centuries, to Edom, abated not their force or certainty; length of life changes not the sinner's doom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/obadiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. against thy brother&#8212;This aggravates the sin of Esau, that it was against him who was his brother by birth and by circumcision.

The Cause of Edom’s Destruction<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The scene changes. Another picture of violence and cruelty now rises before the prophet’s eyes. He sees Jerusalem encompassed by enemies and overcome. Strangers carry away captive her forces, foreigners enter into her gates. And there, not only standing aside in unbrotherly neutrality, but exulting with malicious joy, speaking words of proud scorn, doing acts of robbery and wrong, are seen the Edomites. The two pictures, one of the past, the other of the future, he is commissioned to portray before the eyes of men, and to reveal the hidden link that binds them together in the relationship of cause and effect. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-10.htm" title="For your violence against your brother Jacob shame shall cover you, and you shall be cut off for ever.">Obadiah 1:10</a></span> contains a general statement of the sin and its punishment.

This punishment falls upon her as the result of the malice and unfriendliness which she has displayed to wards Israel in the time of calamity, in that she rejoiced at her sister's disaster and took part with her enemies. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thy violence against thy brother Jacob.</span> The special action to which Obadiah alludes, and which he particularizes in the following verses, occurred at the time of the invasion of Judaea by Philistines and Arabians during the reign of Jehoram, when the Edomites sided with the enemy, and acted as the prophet intimates (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>, etc.; see Introduction, &sect; III.). The iniquity of such conduct is aggravated by the fact that the victim was the "brother Jacob," who was commanded not to hate the Edomites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-7.htm">Deuteronomy 23:7</a>). This enjoined friendship was not reciprocated by the descendants of Esau. Whether from envy at the superior privileges of Israel, or from other causes, the Edomites, from the time of Moses, had always been actively hostile to the Israelites. They had been subdued by David, but had lately rebelled and scoured their independence, and were always looking for an opportunity of revenging themselves on their conquerors (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-12.htm">Ezekiel 25:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shame shall cover thee.</span> Shame for the destruction that hath overtaken thee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-10.htm">Micah 7:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be cut off forever</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-4.htm">Malachi 1:4</a>; see Introduction, &sect; I.). Terrible retribution fell on Idumea in the time of the Maccabees (see 1 Macc. 5:3; 2 Macc. 10:15, etc.; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 12:08. 1), Before that time they had been dispossessed of Petra by the Nabathaeans. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/amos/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Philistia. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-6.htm">Amos 1:6</a>. "Thus saith Jehovah, For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I shall not reverse it, because they carried away captives in full number to deliver them up to Edom, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-7.htm">Amos 1:7</a>. I send fire into the wall of Gaza, and it will eat their palaces; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-8.htm">Amos 1:8</a>. And I exterminate the inhabitant from Ashdod, and the sceptre-holder from Askelon, and turn my hand against Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines will perish, saith the Lord Jehovah." Instead of the Philistines generally, the prophet mentions Gaza in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-6.htm">Amos 1:6</a>. This is still a considerable town, bearing the old name Guzzeh (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>), and was the one of the five capitals of the Philistines which had taken the most active part as a great commercial town in handing over the Israelitish prisoners to the Edomites. For it is evident that Gaza is simply regarded as a representative of Philistia, from the fact that in the announcement of the punishment, the other capitals of Philistia are also mentioned. Ga&#770;lu&#772;th shele&#772;ma&#770;h is correctly explained by Jerome thus: "a captivity so perfect and complete, that not a single captive remained who was not delivered to the Idumaeans." The reference is to captive Israelites, who were carried off by the Philistines, and disposed of by them to the Edomites, the arch-enemies of Israel. Amos no doubt had in his mind the invasion of Judah by the Philistines and tribes of Arabia Petraea in the time of Joram, which is mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>, and to which Joel had already alluded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-3.htm">Joel 3:3</a>., where the Phoenicians and Philistines are threatened with divine retribution for having plundered the land, and sold the captive Judaeans to the Javanites (Ionians). But it by no means follows from this, that the "sons of Javan" mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-6.htm">Joel 3:6</a> are not Greeks, but the inhabitants of the Arabian Javan noticed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-19.htm">Ezekiel 27:19</a>. The fact was simply this: the Philistines sold one portion of the many prisoners, taken at that time, to the Edomites, and the rest to the Phoenicians, who disposed of them again to the Greeks. Joel simply mentions the latter circumstance, because, in accordance with the object of his prophecy, his design was to show the wide dispersion of the Jews, and their future gathering out of all the lands of their banishment. Amos, on the other hand, simply condemns the delivering of the captives to Edom, the arch-foe of Israel, to indicate the greatness of the sin involved in this treatment of the covenant nation, or the hatred which the Philistines had displayed thereby. As a punishment for this, the cities of Philistia would be burned by their enemies, the inhabitants would be exterminated, and the remnant perish. Here again, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/1-4.htm">Amos 1:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/1-5.htm">Amos 1:5</a>, the threat is rhetorically individualized, so that in the case of one city the burning of the city itself is predicted, and in that of another the destruction of its inhabitants. (On Ashdod, Askelon, and Ekron, see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>.) &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1497;&#1491;, to return the hand, i.e., to turn or stretch it out again (see comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3</a>). The use of this expression may be explained on the ground, that the destruction of the inhabitants of Ashdod and Askelon has already been thought of as a stretching out of the hand. The fifth of the Philistian capitals, Gath, is not mentioned, though not for the reason assigned by Kimchi, viz., that it belonged to the kings of Judah, or had been conquered by Uzziah, for Uzziah had not only conquered Gath and Jabneh, but had taken Ashdod as well, and thrown down the walls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>), and yet Amos mentions Ashdod; nor because Gath had been taken by the Syrians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-18.htm">2 Kings 12:18</a>), for this Syrian conquest was not a lasting one, and in the prophet's time (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2</a>), and even later (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-10.htm">Micah 1:10</a>), it still maintained its independence, and was a very distinguished city; but for the simple reason that the individualizing description given by the prophet did not require the complete enumeration of all the capitals, and the idea of been named, but all that was still in existence, and had escaped destruction" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-9.htm">Jeremiah 6:9</a>), it nevertheless includes not merely the four states just named, but every part of Philistia that had hitherto escaped destruction, so that Gath must be included. </body></html>
