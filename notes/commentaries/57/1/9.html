By years, indeed, the difference was, perhaps, not so great as the words might suggest, for Jewish usage extended the term of youth farther than we do, and began age sooner. No doubt, too, Paul’s life had aged him fast, and probably there were not thirty years between the two periods. But the difference between him and himself at the beginning and the end of his career was a gulf; and his life was not evolution, but revolution.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> At the beginning you see a brilliant young Pharisee, Gamaliel’s promising pupil, advanced above many who were his equals in his own religion, as he says himself; living after its straitest sect, and eager to have the smallest part in what seemed to him the righteous slaying of one of the followers of the blaspheming Nazarene. At the end he was himself one of these followers. He had cast off, as folly, the wisdom which took him so much pains to acquire. He had turned his back upon all the brilliant prospects of distinction which were opening to him. He had broken with countrymen and kindred. And what had he made of it? He had been persecuted, hunted, assailed by every weapon that his old companions could fashion or wield; he is a solitary man, laden with many cares, and accustomed to look perils and death in the face; he is a prisoner, and in a year or two more he will be a martyr. If he were an apostate and a renegade, it was not for what he could get by it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> What made the change? The vision of Jesus Christ. If we think of the transformation on Saul, its causes and its outcome, we shall get lessons which I would fain press upon your hearts now. Do you wonder that I would urge on you just such a life as that of this man as your highest good?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. I would note, then, first, that faith in Jesus Christ will transform and ennoble any life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>It has been customary of late years, amongst people who do not like miracles, and do not believe in sudden changes of character, to allege that Paul’s conversion was but the appearance, on the surface, of an underground process that had been going on ever since he kept the witnesses’ clothes. Modern critics know a great deal more about the history of Paul’s conversion than Paul did. For to him there was no consciousness of undermining, but the change was instantaneous. He left Jerusalem a bitter persecutor, exceeding mad against the followers of the Nazarene, thinking that Jesus was a blasphemer and an impostor, and His disciples pestilent vermin, to be harried off the face of the earth. He entered Damascus a lowly disciple of that Christ. His conversion was not an underground process that had been silently sapping the foundations of his life; it was an explosion. And what caused it? What was it that came on that day on the Damascus road, amid the blinding sunshine of an Eastern noontide? The vision of Jesus Christ. An overwhelming conviction flooded his soul that He whom he had taken to be an impostor, richly deserving the Cross that He endured, was living in glory, and was revealing Himself to Saul then and there. That truth crumbled his whole past into nothing; and he stood there trembling and astonished, like a man the ruins of whose house have fallen about his ears. He bowed himself to the vision. He surrendered at discretion without a struggle. ‘Immediately,’ says he, ‘I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,’ and when he said ‘Lord, Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?’ he flung open the gates of the fortress for the Conqueror to come in. The vision of Christ reversed his judgments, transformed his character, revolutionised his life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> That initial impulse operated through all the rest of his career. Hearken to him: ‘I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. To me to live is Christ. Whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Living or dying, we are the Lord’s.’ ‘We labour that whether present or absent, we may be accepted of Him.’ The transforming agency was the vision of Christ, and the bowing of the man’s whole nature before the seen Saviour.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Need I recall to you how noble a life issued from that fountain? I am sure that I need do no more than mention in a word or two the wondrous activity, flashing like a flame of fire from East to West, and everywhere kindling answering flames, the noble self-oblivion, the continual communion with God and the Unseen, and all the other great virtues and nobleness which came from such sources as these. I need only, I am sure, remind you of them, and draw this lesson, that the secret of a transforming and noble life is to be found in faith in Jesus Christ. The vision that changed Paul is as available for you and me. For it is all a mistake to suppose that the essence of it is the miraculous appearance that flashed upon the Apostle’s eyes. He speaks of it himself, in one of his letters, in other language, when he says, ‘It pleased God to reveal His Son <span class="ital">in</span> me.’ And that revelation in all its fulness, in all its sweetness, in all its transforming and ennobling power, is offered to every one of us. For the eye of faith is no less gifted with the power of direct and certain vision-yea! is even more gifted with this-than is the eye of sense. ‘If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead.’ Christ is revealed to each one of us as really, as veritably, and the revelation may become as strong an impulse and motive in our lives as ever it was to the Apostle on the Damascus road. What is wanted is not revelation, but the bowed will-not the heavenly vision, but obedience to the vision. I suppose that most of you think that you believe all that about Jesus Christ, which transformed Gamaliel’s pupil into Christ’s disciple. And what has it done for you? In many cases, nothing. Be sure of this, dear young friends, that the shortest way to a life adorned with all grace, with all nobility, fragrant with all goodness, and permanent as that life which does the will of God must clearly be, is this, to bow before the seen Christ, seen in His word, and speaking to your hearts, and to take His yoke and carry His burden. Then you will build upon what will stand, and make your days noble and your lives stable. If you build on anything else, the structure will come down with a crash some day, and bury you in its ruins. Surely it is better to learn the worthlessness of a non-Christian life, in the light of His merciful face, when there is yet time to change our course, than to see it by the fierce light of the great White Throne set for judgment. We must each of us learn it here or there.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Faith in Christ will make a joyful life, whatever its circumstances.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>I have said that, judged by the standard of the Exchange, or by any of the standards which men usually apply to success in life, this life of the Apostle was a failure. We know, without my dwelling more largely upon it, what he gave up. We know what, to outward appearance, he gained by his Christianity. You remember, perhaps, how he himself speaks about the external aspects of his life in one place, where he says ‘Even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place, and labour, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it; being defamed, we entreat. We are made as the filth of the world, and as the offscouring of all things unto this day.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> That was one side of it. Was that all? This man had that within him which enabled him to triumph over all trials. There is nothing more remarkable about him than the undaunted courage, the unimpaired elasticity of spirit, the buoyancy of gladness, which bore him high upon the waves of the troubled sea in which he had to swim. If ever there was a man that had a bright light burning within him, in the deepest darkness, it was that little weather-beaten Jew, whose ‘bodily presence was weak, and his speech contemptible.’ And what was it that made him master of circumstances, and enabled him to keep sunshine in his heart when winter bound all the world around him? What made this bird sing in a darkened cage? One thing-the continual presence, consciously with Him by faith, of that Christ who had revolutionised his life, and who continued to bless and to gladden it. I have quoted his description of his external condition. Let me quote two or three words that indicate how he took all that sea of troubles and of sorrows that poured its waves and its billows over him. ‘In all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us.’ ‘As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation aboundeth also by Christ.’ ‘For which cause we faint not, but though our outward man perish, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.’ ‘Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.’ ‘I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content.’ ‘As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing all things.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There is the secret of blessedness, my friends; there is the fountain of perpetual joy. Cling to Christ, set His will on the throne of your hearts, give the reins of your life and of your character into His keeping, and nothing ‘that is at enmity with joy’ can either ‘abolish or destroy’ the calm blessedness of your spirits.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> You will have much to suffer; you will have something to give up. Your life may look, to men whose tastes have been vulgarised by the glaring brightnesses of this vulgar world, but grey and sombre, but it will have in it the calm abiding blessedness which is more than joy, and is diviner and more precious than the tumultuous transports of gratified sense or successful ambition. Christ is peace, and He gives His peace to us; and then He gives a joy which does not break but enhances peace. We are all tempted to look for our gladness in creatures, each of which satisfies but a part of our desire. But no man can be truly blessed who has to find many contributories to make up his blessedness. That which makes us rich must be, not a multitude of precious stones, howsoever precious they may be, but one Pearl of great price; the one Christ who is our only joy. And He says to us that He gives us Himself, if we behold Him and bow to Him, that His joy might remain in us, and that our joy might be full, while all other gladnesses are partial and transitory. Faith in Christ makes life blessed. The writer of Ecclesiastes asked the question which the world has been asking ever since: ‘Who knoweth what is good for a man in this life, all the days of this vain life which he passeth as a shadow?’ You young people are asking, ‘Who will show us any good?’ Here is the answer-Faith in Christ and obedience to Him; that is the good part which no man taketh from us. Dear young friend, have you made it yours?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Faith in Christ produces a life which bears being looked back upon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>In a later Epistle than that from which my second text is taken, we get one of the most lovely pictures that was ever drawn, albeit it is unconsciously drawn, of a calm old age, very near the gate of death; and looking back with a quiet heart over all the path of life. I am not going to preach to you, dear friends, in the flush of your early youth, a gospel which is only to be recommended because it is good to die by, but it will do even you, at the beginning, no harm to realise for a moment that the end will come, and that retrospect will take the place in your lives which hope and anticipation fill now. And I ask you what you expect to feel and say then?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> What did Paul say? ‘I have fought the good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.’ He was not self-righteous; but it is possible to have lived a life which, as the world begins to fade, vindicates itself as having been absolutely right in its main trend, and to feel that the dawning light of Eternity confirms the choice that we made. And I pray you to ask yourselves, ‘Is my life of that sort?’ How much of it would bear the scrutiny which will have to come, and which in Paul’s case was so quiet and calm? He had had a stormy day, many a thundercloud had darkened the sky, many a tempest had swept across the plain; but now, as the evening draws on, the whole West is filled with a calm amber light, and all across the plain, right away to the grey East, he sees that he has been led by, and has been willing to walk in, the right way to the ‘City of habitation.’ Would that be your experience if the last moment came now?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There will be, for the best of us, much sense of failure and shortcoming when we look back on our lives. But whilst some of us will have to say, ‘I have played the fool and erred exceedingly,’ it is possible for each of us to lay himself down in peace and sleep, awaiting a glorious rising again and a crown of righteousness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Dear young friends, it is for you to choose whether your past, when you summon it up before you, will look like a wasted wilderness, or like a garden of the Lord. And though, as I have said, there will always be much sense of failure and shortcoming, yet that need not disturb the calm retrospect; for whilst memory sees the sins, faith can grasp the Saviour, and quietly take leave of life, saying, ‘I know in whom I have believed, and that He is able to keep that which I have committed to Him against that day.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So I press upon you all this one truth, that faith in Jesus Christ will transform, will ennoble, will make joyous your lives whilst you live, and will give you a quiet heart in the retrospect when you come to die. Begin right, dear young friends. You will never find it so easy to take any decisive step, and most of all this chiefest step, as you do to-day. You will get lean and less flexible as you get older. You will get set in your ways. Habits will twine their tendrils round you, and hinder your free movement. The truth of the Gospel will become commonplace by familiarity. Associations and companions will have more and more power over you; and you will be stiffened as an old tree-trunk is stiffened. You cannot count on to-morrow; be wise to-day. Begin this year aright. Why should you not now see the Christ and welcome Him? I pray that every one of us may behold Him and fall before Him with the cry, ‘Lord! what wilt Thou have me to do?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1&emsp;&emsp;To the young.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philemon/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:8-14 It does not lower any one to condescend, and sometimes even to beseech, where, in strictness of right, we might command: the apostle argues from love, rather than authority, in behalf of one converted through his means; and this was Onesimus. In allusion to that name, which signifies profitable, the apostle allows that in time past he had been unprofitable to Philemon, but hastens to mention the change by which he had become profitable. Unholy persons are unprofitable; they answer not the great end of their being. But what happy changes conversion makes! of evil, good; of unprofitable, useful. Religious servants are treasures in a family. Such will make conscience of their time and trusts, and manage all they can for the best. No prospect of usefulness should lead any to neglect their obligations, or to fail in obedience to superiors. One great evidence of true repentance consists in returning to practise the duties which have been neglected. In his unconverted state, Onesimus had withdrawn, to his master's injury; but now he had seen his sin and repented, he was willing and desirous to return to his duty. Little do men know for what purposes the Lord leaves some to change their situations, or engage in undertakings, perhaps from evil motives. Had not the Lord overruled some of our ungodly projects, we may reflect upon cases, in which our destruction must have been sure.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philemon/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yet for love's sake - For the love which you bear me, and for the common cause.<p>I rather beseech thee - Rather than command thee.<p>Being such an one as Paul the aged - &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  presbute&#772;s - an old man. We have no means of ascertaining the exact age of Paul at this time, and I do not recollect that he ever alludes to his age, though he often does to his infirmities, in any place except here. Doddridge supposes that at the time when Stephen was stoned, when he is called "a young man" (&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  neanias, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>), he was 24 years of age, in which case he would now have been about 53. Chrysostom supposes that he may have been 35 years old at the time of his conversion, which would have made him about 63 at this time. The difficulty of determining with any degree of accuracy the age of the apostle at this time, arises from the indefinite nature of the word used by Luke, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>, and rendered "a young man." That word, like the corresponding word &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  neaniskos, was applied to men in the vigor of manhood up to the age of 40 years.<p>Robinson, Lex. Phavorinus says a man is called &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  neaniskos, a young man, until he is 28; and &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  presbute&#772;s, presbute&#772;s, from 49 until he is 56. Varro says that a man is young ("juvenis"), until he is 45, and aged at 60. Whitby. These periods of time, however, are very indefinite, but it will accord well with the usual meaning of the words to suppose that Paul was in the neighborhood of 30 when he was converted, and that he was now not far from 60. We are to remember also, that the constitution of Paul may have been much broken by his labors, his perils, and his trials. Not advanced probably to the usual limit of human life, he may have had all the characteristics of a very aged man; compare the note of Benson. The argument here is, that we feel that it is proper, as far as we can, to grant the request of an old man. Paul thus felt that it was reasonable to suppose that Philemon would not refuse to gratify the wishes of an aged servant of Christ, who had spent the vigor of his life in the service of their common Master. It should be a very strong case when we refuse to gratify the wishes of an aged Christian in anything, especially if he has rendered important services to the church and the world.<p>And now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ - In the cause of Jesus Christ; or a prisoner for endeavoring to make him known to the world; compare the <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-20.htm">Ephesians 6:20</a> notes; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a> note. The argument here is, that it might be presumed that Philemon would not refuse the request of one who was suffering in prison on account of their common religion. For such a prisoner we should be ready to do all that we can to mitigate the sorrows of his confinement, and to make his condition comfortable. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philemon/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. for love's sake&#8212;mine to thee, and (what ought to be) thine to Onesimus.

Either for the sake of the great love which the apostle bore to Philemon, being, as he calls him, his dearly beloved, he took this method; or because of Philemon's great love to all the saints before mentioned, he was encouraged to proceed in this manner, hoping on that account to have success; or it may be, it was for the sake of that love with which God had loved him, and which he puts him in mind of, to engage him to grant his request; that seeing God the Father had loved him, and chosen him in Christ; and Christ had loved him, and redeemed him by his blood; and the Holy Spirit had loved him, and sanctified him by his grace, that therefore he would receive his servant again for the sake of this love; who also was the object of it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-30.htm">Romans 15:30</a>. The Alexandrian copy reads, "for", or "through necessity", as if necessity obliged him to this request, <p>Being such an one as Paul the aged; or "the elder"; meaning either in office, which he might mention with this view, that his request might have the greater weight and influence; or else in years, and which he might observe partly to move compassion in Philemon, and that he might not grieve him in his old age, as he would, should he deny his request; and partly to suggest to him, that the advice he was about to give him, to receive his servant, did not come from a raw young man, but from one well stricken in years, with whom were wisdom and understanding; and therefore not to be treated with neglect or contempt: how old the apostle was at this time, is not certain; he could not be less than sixty years of age, or he would not have called himself an old man; for no man was so called by the Jews, but he that was at the age of sixty (b). Some editions of the Vulgate Latin version, as that of the London Polyglot Bible, read, "seeing thou art such an one as Paul the aged"; as if Philemon was an old man, as the apostle was, and therefore he would not lay his commands upon him, as an ancient man might upon a young man, but rather entreat him as equal to him in years: but then it follows, which does not appear to be true of Philemon, or that he was in the like case, <p>and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ; which is observed with the same view as in Plm 1:1.

According to de Wette (comp.

(2) The elements expressed by <span class="greekheb">ὡς Παῦλος</span> … <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ</span> stand—seeing that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΕΣΒΎΤΗς</span></span></span> is a <span class="ital">substantive</span> and has not the article—in <span class="ital">such</span> relation to each other, that <span class="greekheb">πρεσβύτης</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΥΝῚ ΔῈ ΚΑῚ ΔΈΣΜΙΟς Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> are two <span class="ital">attributive</span> statements attaching themselves to <span class="greekheb">Παῦλος</span>; consequently: <span class="ital">as Paul, who is an old man, and now also a prisoner</span>, etc. (3) The (flexible) notion of <span class="greekheb">πρεσβύτης</span> must by no means have its meaning altered, as is done <span class="ital">e.g.</span> by Calvin, who makes it denote “non aetatem, sed <span class="ital">officium</span>;” but, at the same time, may not be rigidly pressed in so confidential a private writing, in which “lepos mixtus gravitate” (Bengel), prevails, especially if Philemon was <span class="ital">much younger</span> than Paul.

Here, precisely as in our passage, <span class="greekheb">ὡς εὔνους</span> belongs <span class="ital">not</span> to <span class="greekheb">τοιοῦτος ὤν</span>, but to what follows, and <span class="greekheb">τοιοῦτος ὤν</span> sums up what had been said before.—The comparison of <span class="greekheb">τοιόσδε</span>, Hom. <span class="ital">od.</span> xvi. 205 (Hofmann), where besides no <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> follows, is unsuitable, partly on the general ground of the well-known diversity of meaning of the two words (comp. Kühner, <span class="ital">ad Xen. Mem.</span> i. 7. 5), which is not to be abandoned without special reason, partly because in that passage <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ τοιόσδε</span> stands absolutely and <span class="greekheb">δεικτικῶς</span> (<span class="ital">hicce ego talis</span>), so that the following <span class="greekheb">παθὼν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. belongs to <span class="greekheb">ἤλυθον</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[73] That the expression: <span class="ital">in the bonds</span>, was suitable only to Rome and not to Caesarea, is incorrectly inferred by Wieseler, p. 420, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-23.htm" title="And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come to him.">Acts 24:23</a>. See on that passage. It was likewise incorrect to assign the Epistle, on account of <span class="greekheb">πρεσβύτης</span>, to the alleged <span class="ital">second</span> imprisonment at Rome (Calovius).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/philemon/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-9.htm" title="Yet for love's sake I rather beseech you, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.">Philemon 1:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">τοιοῦτος ὢν ὡς</span>: “<span class="greekheb">τοιοῦτος</span> can be defined only by a following adjective, or by <span class="greekheb">οἷος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅσος</span>, or <span class="greekheb">ὤστε</span> with the infinitive; never by <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span>” (Vincent). It seems, therefore, best to take <span class="greekheb">τοιοῦτος ὤν</span> as referring to … <span class="greekheb">μᾶλλον παρακλῶ</span>, which is taken up again in the next verse; <span class="greekheb">ὡς Παῦλος</span> … <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦ</span> must be regarded as though in brackets; <span class="greekheb">τοιοῦτος ὢν</span> would then mean “one who beseeches”.—<span class="greekheb">πρεσβύτης</span>: this can scarcely be in reference to age, for which <span class="greekheb">γέρων</span> would be more likely to have been used; besides, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-58.htm" title="And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.">Acts 7:58</a>, at the martyrdom of St. Stephen, the term <span class="greekheb">νεανίας</span> is applied to St. Paul. Lightfoot in his interesting note on this verse, says: “There is reason for thinking that in the common dialect <span class="greekheb">πρεσβύτης</span> may have been written indifferently for <span class="greekheb">πρεσβευτής</span> in St. Paul’s time; and if so, the form here may be due, not to some comparatively late scribe, but to the original autograph itself or to an immediate transcript”; and he gives a number of instances of the form <span class="greekheb">πρεσβύτης</span> being used for <span class="greekheb">πρεσβευτής</span>. If, as seems very likely, we should translate the word “ambassador” here, then we have the striking parallel in the contemporary epistle to the <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-20.htm" title="For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.">Ephesians 6:20</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ οὗ πρεσβεύω ἐν ἁλύσει</span>. Deissmann (<span class="ital">Licht vom Osten</span>, p. 273) points out that both the verb <span class="greekheb">πρεσβεύω</span>, and the substantive <span class="greekheb">πρεσβευτής</span>, were used in the Greek Orient for expressing the title of the Legatus of the emperor. Accepting the meaning “ambassador” here, the significance of the passage is much increased; for Christ’s ambassador had the right to command, but in merely exhorting he throws so much more responsibility on Philemon. The word “ambassador” would be at least as strong an assertion of authority as “apostle”; to a Greek, indeed, more so.—<span class="greekheb">δέσμιος</span>: perhaps mentioned for the purpose of hinting that in respect of bondage his position was not unlike that of him for whom he is about to plead; <span class="ital">cf.</span> the way in which St. Paul identifies himself with Onesimus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-12.htm" title="Whom I have sent again: you therefore receive him, that is, my own bowels:">Philemon 1:12</a> … <span class="greekheb">αὐτόν</span>, <span class="greekheb">τοῦτʼ ἔστιν τὰ ἐμὰ σπλάγχνα</span>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-17.htm" title="If you count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.">Philemon 1:17</a> … <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἐμέ</span>.—<span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ</span>: belongs both to <span class="greekheb">πρεσβύτης</span> and to <span class="greekheb">δέσμιος</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow laborer,">Philemon 1:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm" title="For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,">Ephesians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm" title="I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation with which you are called,">Ephesians 4:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-8.htm" title="Be not you therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be you partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;">2 Timothy 1:8</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/philemon/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">for love’s sake</span>] Lit., “<span class="ital">because of the love</span>”<span class="ital">;</span> i.e., perhaps, “because of <span class="ital">our</span> love.” Ellicott, Alford, and Lightfoot take the reference to be to (Christian) love in general. But the Greek commentators (cent. 11) Theophylact and Œcumenius (quoted by Ellicott) explain the phrase as referring to <span class="ital">the</span> love of the two friends; and this is surely in point in this message of personal affection.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">beseech</span>] The verb is one which often means “<span class="ital">exhort</span>,” in a sense less tender than “<span class="ital">beseech</span>.” But see e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-2.htm" title="I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.">Php 4:2</a> for a case where, as here, it evidently conveys a <span class="ital">loving</span> appeal.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">being such a one as</span>] Does this mean, “<span class="ital">because</span> I am such,” or “<span class="ital">although</span> I am such”? The answer depends mainly on the explanation of the next following words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Paul the aged</span>] <span class="ital">Paulus senex</span>, Latin Versions; “and so apparently all versions” (Ellicott). So R.V. text. Its margin has “<span class="ital">Paul an ambassador</span>”<span class="ital">;</span> and this rendering is advocated by Lightfoot in a long and instructive note. He points out that not only are <span class="ital">presbûtês</span> (“<span class="ital">an elder</span>,” which all mss. have here) and <span class="ital">presbeutês</span> (“<span class="ital">an envoy</span>”) nearly identical in form, but that the latter word was often spelt by the Greeks like the former. And he points to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-20.htm" title="For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.">Ephesians 6:20</a> (see our note there), where “<span class="ital">the ambassador in chains</span>” expressly describes himself—a passage written perhaps on the same day as this. So explaining, the phrase would be a quiet reminder, in the act of entreaty, that the suppliant was no ordinary one; he was the Lord’s envoy, dignified by suffering for the Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But, with reverence to the great Commentator, is not the other explanation after all more in character in this Epistle, which carries a tender pathos in it everywhere? A fresh reminder of his <span class="ital">dignity</span>, after the passing and as it were rejected allusion to it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-8.htm" title="Why, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin you that which is convenient,">Philemon 1:8</a>, seems to us to be out of harmony; while nothing could be more fitting here than a word about age and affliction. The question whether St Paul was “an old man,” as we commonly reckon age, is not important; so Lightfoot himself points out. At all periods, men have called themselves old when they felt so; Lightfoot instances Sir Walter Scott at fifty-five. (St Paul was probably quite sixty at this time.) And it is immaterial whether or no Philemon was his junior. If he were Paul’s coeval, it would matter little. The appeal lies in the fact of the writer’s “failing powers,” worn in the Lord’s service; and this would touch an equal as readily as a junior. To our mind too the phrase, “<span class="ital">being such a one as</span>,” conveys, though it is hard to analyse the impression, the thought of a pathetic <span class="ital">self-depreciation</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the whole we recommend the rendering of the A.V. and (text) R.V.
