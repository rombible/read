However, he is not mentioned as a prisoner in Col 4:12, so that "fellow prisoner" here may mean merely one who was a faithful companion to Paul in his imprisonment, and by his society put himself in the position of a prisoner. So also "Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner," Col 4:10, may mean. Benson conjectures the meaning to be that on some former occasion these two were Paul's "fellow prisoners," not at the time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/philemon/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> We read of this <span class="bld">Epaphras, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-7.htm" title=" As you also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;">Colossians 1:7</a></span>, where he is called Paul’s <span class="bld">fellow servant, </span> and <span class="bld">a faithful minister of Christ:</span> he was with Paul at Rome, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm" title=" Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.">Colossians 4:12</a></span>, but there is no mention of him as a prisoner; but now he was a <span class="bld">fellow prisoner</span> with Paul, either in the same place, or upon the same account. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/philemon/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>There salute thee Epaphras,....

As to <span class="cmt_word">Epaphras</span>, see above. <span class="cmt_word">Marcus</span>, having once forsaken the apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-37.htm">Acts 15:37-39</a>), had now returned, and was with him in Rome. <span class="cmt_word">Aristarchus</span> was "a Macedonian of Thessalonica," and had accompanied St. Paul in his memorable voyage to Rome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-2.htm">Acts 27:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Demas</span> was now the "co-worker" of the apostle at Rome, but at a later period he had departed unto Thessalonica (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>), and we know nothing of his subsequent history. Tradition (Epiph., 'Haer.,' 41:6) relates that he also apostatized from Christianity; but the apostle's phrase, though a strong one, does not necessarily mean this. <span class="cmt_word">Lucas</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-18.htm">2 Corinthians 8:18</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/philemon/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Epaphras my fellow prisoner (&#x395;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;).<p>Epaphras is mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>. Some identify him with Epaphroditus, but without sufficient reason. Epaphroditus appears to have been a native of Philippi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a>), and Epaphras of Colossae (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>). Epaphroditus is always used of the Philippian, and Epaphras of the Colossian. The names, however, are the same, Epaphras being a contraction.<p>It is disputed whether fellow-prisoner is to be taken in a literal or in a spiritual sense. For the latter see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm">Romans 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-5.htm">2 Corinthians 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8</a>. Compare fellow-soldier, Plm 1:2, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/16-7.htm">Romans 16:7</a>, the word used here is applied to Andronicus and Junia. Paul was not strictly an &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; prisoner of war (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>). The probabilities seem to favor the spiritual sense. Lightfoot suggests that Epaphras' relations with Paul at Rome may have excited suspicion and led to his temporally confinement; or that he may voluntarily have shared Paul's imprisonment. </body></html>
