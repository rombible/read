(1) One is that “faith” here (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-3.htm" title="For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?">Romans 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm" title="But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,">Galatians 5:22</a>) is simply fidelity; but this can hardly be accepted as an explanation of so well-known and almost technical a phrase as “faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ.” (2) Another, noting the distinction in the original between the two prepositions here—the former (<span class= "ital">pros</span>) signifying direction towards, and the latter (<span class= "ital">eis</span>) actual contact with, its object—explains the phrase as signifying “the faith which has as its object the Lord Jesus Christ, but which shows itself practically towards all saints.” But this, even if the word “hast” will bear this gloss, seems too artificial for such a Letter as this. (3) The comparison with the contemporaneous Letter to the Colossians—where we read, “your faith in the Lord Jesus, and your love toward all the saints” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm" title=" Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints,">Colossians 1:4</a>)—seems to clear up the matter. We have here an equivalent phrase, in which, however (by what the grammarians called <span class= "ital">chiasmus</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>the extremes and means correspond to each other. The idea which runs through the Letter is Philemon’s “love to the saints.” In writing of that love St. Paul cannot refrain from (4) referring it to its true origin—the faith towards the Lord Jesus Christ. Hence the broken phrase. The sense seems therefore to be that which in some MSS. has been brought out by a natural correction, “thy faith towards the Lord Jesus, and thy love to all the saints.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philemon/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 Faith in Christ, and love to him, should unite saints more closely than any outward relation can unite the people of the world. Paul in his private prayers was particular in remembering his friends. We must remember Christian friends much and often, as their cases may need, bearing them in our thoughts, and upon our hearts, before our God. Different sentiments and ways in what is not essential, must not make difference of affection, as to the truth. He inquired concerning his friends, as to the truth, growth, and fruitfulness of their graces, their faith in Christ, and love to him, and to all the saints. The good which Philemon did, was matter of joy and comfort to him and others, who therefore desired that he would continue and abound in good fruits, more and more, to God's honour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philemon/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hearing of thy love and faith - Either by Onesimus, who, after his conversion, would be disposed to state all that he knew that was favorable of Philemon, or hearing it by some other persons who had come from Colosse to Rome. The faith which is mentioned here refers to the Lord Jesus; the love, to the saints. The order in the Greek is indeed the same as in our version, but it is not unusual by synthesis, or uniting two or more things together, to arrange words in that manner. Thus <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-22.htm">Matthew 12:22</a>, "The blind and dumb both spake and saw;" that is, the blind saw, and the dumb spake. The meaning is, that he had strong faith in the Lord Jesus, and ardent love toward all who were Christians.

Hearing&#8212;the ground of his thanksgiving. It is a delicate mark of authenticity, that he says "hearing" as to churches and persons whom he had not seen or then visited. Now Colosse, Philemon's place of residence, he had never yet seen. Yet Phm 19 here implies that Philemon was his convert. Philemon, doubtless, was converted at Ephesus, or in some other place where he met Paul.<p>love and faith&#8212;The theological order is first faith then love, the fruit of faith.

Those two spring from the free favour and love of God, and are the pure gifts of his grace; and therefore thanks are to be given for them to God; nor are they to be ascribed to the power and will of man; they are the fruits of the Spirit of God; and are the principal ingredients in sanctification, which is entirely his work; and they are in all regenerate persons; and are the evidences of regeneration; by which it is known that men are passed from death to life; and they always go together, and are inseparable from each other: there cannot be true faith where love is wanting, for faith works by love; and there cannot be real love, where there is not faith; they only love the saints aright, who love them in the faith, and because of it; and these graces are visible, and to be known by their fruits, whereby they come to be heard of, and talked of, as these in Philemon were. Faith in the heart is confessed by the mouth; and love, both to Christ and to his people, shows itself, as well as faith, in works of righteousness. Sometimes faith is put before love, it being a leading grace, and the great receiver of all the blessings of grace; and here love is placed before faith, because of its being more excellent on account of its continuance and duration; or there may be no design at all in it; but rather, as sometimes one, and sometimes another is mentioned first, it shows that they are upon an equal foot, and both have their proper place and usefulness; the objects of them follow: <p>which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; which are either to be considered as equally objects of the same grace, or as distinct ones; that is, either that Christ is the object both of faith and love, and the saints are the object both of faith and love; or else these graces are to be distinguished by their respective objects; as that faith is toward Christ, and love toward all the saints: that Christ is both the object of faith and love is certain; nor is there any difficulty to consider him as such; faith is equally to be exercised on him, as on God the Father; and he is indeed the immediate object of faith, and by whom men believe in God; and he is to be loved, and is loved by his people above all things, and at all times, and in sincerity: and that the saints are the objects of the love of all truly gracious souls, is a plain case; but the greater difficulty is, how they should be the objects of their faith; and yet there are instances of this, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-31.htm">Exodus 14:31</a> and indeed, true love believes all things, and hopes all things, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-7.htm">1 Corinthians 13:7</a>. But it seems better to divide these objects according to the different graces, and to consider faith as being towards our Lord Jesus; which is a looking towards Christ, a moving towards him, a laying hold upon him, and embracing him, a staying and leaning on him, a living upon him, and walking in him; and which in Philemon might be a strong one, as well as unfeigned, and operative: and love may be considered as being toward all saints; for though all men are, in a sense, to be loved, and kindness to be shown to them, and that even to enemies, yet more especially the saints; who are set apart by God the Father, whose sins are expiated by the blood of Christ, and who are internally sanctified by the Spirit, and are enabled to live soberly and righteously: and all of these are the objects of love, whether rich or poor, greater or lesser believers, of meaner or larger abilities; for they are all equally loved by God, redeemed by Christ, and regenerated by his Spirit; are justified by his righteousness, are all the children and heirs of God, and are called in one hope of their calling; and love to them should be unfeigned, fervent, active, and laborious, and as Christ has loved us; and such was Philemon's love, as well as it was universal and this distribution of these graces to their respective objects may be confirmed from a parallel place in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4</a> which epistle was written and sent at the same time with this. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/philemon/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/philemon/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-5.htm" title="Hearing of your love and faith, which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;">Philemon 1:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀκούων</span>: probably from Epaphras, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-7.htm" title=" As you also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;...">Colossians 1:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm" title=" Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.">Colossians 4:12</a> (Lightfoot).—<span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀγάπην</span> …: <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the faith which thou hast towards the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love which thou showest to all the saints. “The logical order,” says Lightfoot, “is violated, and the clauses are inverted in the second part of the sentence, thus producing an example of the figure called chiasm; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,...">Galatians 4:4-5</a>. This results here from the apostle’s setting down the thoughts in the sequence in which they occur to him, without paying regard to symmetrical arrangement. The first and prominent thought is Philemon’s love. This suggests the mention of his faith, as the source from which it springs. This again requires a reference to the object of faith. And then, at length, comes the deferred sequel to the first thought—the range and comprehensiveness of his love.”—<span class="greekheb">πίστιν</span>: not “faithfulness,” but “faith” (belief), <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-13.htm" title="And now stays faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>.—<span class="greekheb">πρὸς</span> … <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span>: the difference in these propositions is noteworthy, <span class="greekheb">πρὸς</span> refers to the “faith” to Christ-ward (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-8.htm" title="For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.">1 Thessalonians 1:8</a>), <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> to the love to the saints: both are developed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philemon/1-6.htm" title="That the communication of your faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus....">Philemon 1:6-7</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τοὺς ἁγίους</span>: St. Paul intends Onesimus to be thought of here. The original significance of the title <span class="greekheb">ἅγιος</span>, as applied to men, may be seen in such a phrase as, “Ye shall be holy, for I, the Lord your God, am holy” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-2.htm" title="Speak to all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say to them, You shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy.">Leviticus 19:2</a>). To the Jew, like St. Paul, the corresponding root in Hebrew connoted the idea of something set apart, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, consecrated to the service of God (<span class="ital">cf. e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-31.htm" title="And you shall be holy men to me: neither shall you eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; you shall cast it to the dogs.">Exodus 22:31</a> [29]). The <span class="greekheb">ἁγίοι</span> constituted originally the <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησία</span>; and just as, according to the meaning underlying the Hebrew equivalent of the word <span class="greekheb">ἅγιος</span>, separation for God’s service was the main conception, so, according to the root-meaning of <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησία</span>, it connoted the idea of the body of those “called out,” and thus separated from the world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/philemon/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">hearing</span>] doubtless from Epaphras, perhaps with Onesimus’ confirmation from <span class="ital">his</span> point of view.

The whole letter is from love to love.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">faith</span>] Some commentators (see Ellicott’s note, where the view is discussed and rejected) explain this as “<span class="ital">fidelity</span>” (as probably <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm" title="But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,">Galatians 5:22</a> and certainly <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-10.htm" title="Not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.">Titus 2:10</a>). But that meaning is rare in St Paul, and needs strong evidence for adoption in any given case. The ruling meaning, “<span class="ital">trust, reliance</span>,” is quite in place here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">toward … toward</span>] The “received” Greek text, retained here by Lightfoot, has two different prepositions, which we may render <span class="bld">toward</span> and <span class="bld">unto</span> respectively; “<span class="ital">toward</span>” the Object of faith, “<span class="ital">unto</span>” the objects of love.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">toward the Lord … saints</span>] R.V. (and so Alford) reads the whole passage; “<span class="ital">thy love, and the faith which thou hast toward</span> &c.,” making “<span class="ital">the faith</span>” only, not “<span class="ital">thy love</span>,” refer to <span class="ital">both</span> the Lord and the saints; (the man’s reliance on Christ <span class="ital">coming out in</span> a “work of faith,” called briefly “<span class="ital">faith</span>”—see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-6.htm" title="That the communication of your faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.">Philemon 1:6</a>—towards the saints). But Lightfoot, we think rightly, distributes the references of love and faith, cross-wise, to the saints and the Lord respectively.
